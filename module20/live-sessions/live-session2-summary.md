# Module 20 Live Session 2 Summary

## Capstone Project Updates & EDA Discussion

### EDA Expectations
- For image classification projects:
  - Focus on understanding dataset characteristics
  - Analyze image distributions and patterns
  - Build theories and assumptions about the data
  - Document image types, counts per category, and relevant statistics

### EDA Visualization Types
1. **Univariate Analysis**
   - Histograms
   - Box plots
   - Bar charts
   - Pie charts

2. **Bivariate Analysis**
   - Scatter plots
   - Stacked bar charts
   - Grouped box plots

3. **Multivariate Analysis**
   - Heat maps
   - Pair plots
   - 3D plots

### EDA Best Practices
- Perform basic data cleaning before EDA
- Conduct EDA before data imputation
- Focus on building and testing hypotheses
- Use visualizations to support theories and assumptions

## Ensemble Learning Models

### Overview
- Uses multiple models working together instead of a single model
- Aims to improve precision and reduce errors
- Two main approaches: Bagging and Boosting

### Bagging (Bootstrap Aggregating)
- Multiple models work in parallel on different data subsets
- Combines results from all models
- Example: Random Forest
- Best for:
  - Large datasets
  - Random errors
  - Binary classification tasks

### Boosting
- Models work sequentially, learning from previous errors
- Each model improves upon errors from previous models
- Examples: AdaBoost, Gradient Boost
- Best for:
  - Smaller datasets
  - Complex tasks
  - Systematic errors

### Implementation Tips
1. Start with simple baseline models
2. Add complexity gradually
3. Document performance improvements
4. Consider breaking complex problems into smaller sub-problems
5. Choose between bagging and boosting based on:
   - Dataset size
   - Number of variables
   - Error patterns
   - Performance requirements

## Model Evaluation Discussion

### Classification Metrics
- Discussion of precision, recall, and F1 scores
- Understanding weighted vs unweighted metrics
- Importance of considering business context when choosing metrics
- Handling imbalanced classes

### Best Practices
1. Start with simpler models before trying complex solutions
2. Consider business requirements when choosing evaluation metrics
3. Pay attention to class weightage based on use case
4. Document assumptions and validation approaches

## Key Takeaways
1. Focus on thorough EDA before model building
2. Choose ensemble methods based on data characteristics
3. Consider business context when selecting evaluation metrics
4. Start simple and increase complexity as needed
5. Document assumptions and validation approaches throughout the process
