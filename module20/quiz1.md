# Module 20 Quiz 1

## Question 1 (1 point)
What type of function takes a sample and returns a prediction?

**Options:**
1. Classification function
2. Loss function
3. Prediction function
4. Optimization function

**Answer:** Option 3: Prediction function

A prediction function is a mathematical function that maps input samples to output predictions. It is the core component that takes features as input and produces predictions, distinct from loss functions (which measure error) or optimization functions (which minimize loss).

## Question 2 (1 point)
Which of the following is an example of bagging?

**Options:**
1. AdaBag
2. Gradient boosted tree
3. Random forest
4. AdaBoost

**Answer:** Option 3: Random forest

Random forest is a classic example of bagging (Bootstrap AGGregatING), where multiple decision trees are trained independently on bootstrap samples of the training data. This is distinct from boosting methods like AdaBoost and gradient boosting, which train models sequentially.

## Question 3 (1 point)
What is the important condition for trusting the wisdom of the crowd?

**Options:**
1. The decisions are biased
2. The decisions are made dependently
3. The decisions are made independently
4. The decisions are correlated

**Answer:** Option 3: The decisions are made independently

Independence of decisions is the fundamental requirement for crowd wisdom to be effective. When decisions are made independently, individual errors tend to cancel out, leading to more accurate aggregate predictions. Dependent or correlated decisions can amplify biases and errors.

## Answer Key

1. Option 3: Prediction function (Core ML concept - maps inputs to predictions)
2. Option 3: Random forest (Example of bagging - multiple independent trees)
3. Option 3: Independent decisions (Fundamental principle of crowd wisdom)
