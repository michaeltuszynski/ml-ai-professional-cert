1
00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:07.470
Vikesh K: The time change, so I'm not sure it. I saw California. It's still 9 Am. And I believe most of most of the folks are in California

2
00:00:07.842 --> 00:00:12.289
Vikesh K: so I think it's might be pretty early, so I'm not sure how many people would be able to join.

3
00:00:12.550 --> 00:00:20.740
Vikesh K: But nevertheless, we will make best use of this time. Hopefully, I have one simple case study, which I would maybe take you through.

4
00:00:20.960 --> 00:00:34.710
Vikesh K: and then what we can do also is, I see science also. Here. We can also talk about your capstone project in case, you know, you want to discuss anything. We can have a quick discussion on that as well, because now we are nearing towards the end of the course.

5
00:00:34.890 --> 00:00:35.530
Vikesh K: And

6
00:00:36.340 --> 00:00:50.100
Vikesh K: it's very important that all of you are comfortable with. You know where your capstone is, how you're approaching it, because that's like the main component of this course. Whatever you have learned we will put, you know, you will be able to put it together

7
00:00:50.250 --> 00:00:55.140
Vikesh K: via the capstone. Hence capstone becomes very important, and it's also a mandatory

8
00:00:55.605 --> 00:00:58.659
Vikesh K: component. Of the course. You know, you need to

9
00:00:59.720 --> 00:01:07.509
Vikesh K: score good marks in there and submit a capstone to successfully complete the program. So you know, we can talk about that as well.

10
00:01:07.950 --> 00:01:11.179
Vikesh K: But other than that, how's the course going for all of you?

11
00:01:13.460 --> 00:01:14.680
Chetan Chaganti: Yeah, it's going good so far. Yeah.

12
00:01:15.500 --> 00:01:17.420
Vikesh K: Okay, okay, that's cool.

13
00:01:18.220 --> 00:01:28.420
Sai: Yeah. So yeah. So we we will also have session on 28, th right? I have some other questions as well, which I want to discuss with you.

14
00:01:28.570 --> 00:01:41.169
Vikesh K: Yes, yes, yes, we were in our one to one it would be if you if you have any, maybe additional questions I think you have shared that slide with me. If you can maybe list down that questions tag me.

15
00:01:41.390 --> 00:01:52.250
Vikesh K: That would be also make make it easy. So that let's say, if I need to, maybe the search on that some of the questions, or prepare it better. It will give me, you know, some some time to do that.

16
00:01:52.420 --> 00:01:56.019
Vikesh K: and then we can have a very focused. And you know, productivity.

17
00:01:56.930 --> 00:01:58.490
Sai: Yeah. Sure. Sure. Vikesh.

18
00:01:58.970 --> 00:02:00.710
Vikesh K: Thank you. That's that's helpful.

19
00:02:01.680 --> 00:02:02.500
Vikesh K: Okay.

20
00:02:03.200 --> 00:02:04.279
Namrata: That what I mean.

21
00:02:05.580 --> 00:02:13.370
Namrata: what I made the mistakes and all. I'll I think I'm fixing them, and we'll be on to the capstone after that.

22
00:02:13.610 --> 00:02:20.900
Vikesh K: Okay, okay, sounds good. I also realize, I believe there's some, you know, as in between. I had paused recording, I think

23
00:02:21.940 --> 00:02:28.160
Vikesh K: Big Chunk of the session, maybe, is not recorded. So that let's see I don't know where where I

24
00:02:28.350 --> 00:02:29.509
Vikesh K: was in between

25
00:02:30.430 --> 00:02:36.020
Vikesh K: cool others. If there are no more questions we can call it a day. Then.

26
00:02:36.640 --> 00:02:37.180
shashi: Yeah.

27
00:02:37.490 --> 00:02:38.000
Vikesh K: Yeah.

28
00:02:38.000 --> 00:02:47.240
Namrata: Yeah. So because you are good for the 8th of March, right? I think it's in my morning. So it should be 8th evening for you. I guess.

29
00:02:47.240 --> 00:03:08.729
Vikesh K: Yeah, yeah, I think it. I would apologize in advance in case I I change it. Because you know, sometimes what happens, I'm I'm still traveling around within India. So something odd happens. And then I have to change plans. That happened with sign. We we're supposed to have a meeting today at this time. But unfortunately, the office are also need to be happen at this time.

30
00:03:09.881 --> 00:03:31.289
Vikesh K: But but what I would recommend in any case. You know you book a session with me. Please send me that deck and list down your questions so that at least you don't even have to wait for the session. I can some of the questions always. I can answer asynchronously, so I will go to your slides, and I will start answering your questions, so you don't even have to wait for me to you know, to have the session with me.

31
00:03:31.940 --> 00:03:43.050
Namrata: Sure. Sure. Yeah, I I'll try to do that. Yeah. And and anytime like, I mean, depends on your availability. You can always reschedule. That's fine. I think I'll find out some time at around that time.

32
00:03:43.050 --> 00:03:45.210
Vikesh K: Okay, sure, that's very kind of you. Thank you.

33
00:03:46.630 --> 00:03:53.109

34
00:03:53.520 --> 00:03:55.630
Lakshmi: Yeah, all good. It's Lakshmi.

35
00:03:56.300 --> 00:03:57.490
Vikesh K: Cool. Thank you.

36
00:03:57.490 --> 00:03:59.129
Lakshmi: Yeah, thank you so much.

37
00:04:02.170 --> 00:04:03.109
Vikesh K: So I believe.

38
00:04:03.840 --> 00:04:26.700
Sai: Yeah, we'll meet on 28.th So it is at 8 15 pst. Time. So I am good. Same here. If you have anything any hiccups or like. If you're busy, it's fine. I am available most of the time, so only when you mention any day or time, please let us know which time zone you're talking about. If you say.

39
00:04:26.700 --> 00:04:29.590
Vikesh K: Yeah, sure. Sure. Okay, I'm sorry about that. Yeah, I will do that.

40
00:04:29.720 --> 00:04:33.660
Sai: That would be helpful otherwise. Yeah, I'm good. Yeah, thank you.

41
00:04:33.660 --> 00:04:34.340
Vikesh K: Cool.

42
00:04:34.710 --> 00:04:35.520
Vikesh K: Sounds good.

43
00:04:36.500 --> 00:04:38.389
Vikesh K: Preeti. Good. All good.

44
00:04:43.540 --> 00:04:44.240
Vikesh K: Okay.

45
00:04:45.370 --> 00:04:50.105
Vikesh K: Okay, Preeti. Also, I believe the chat. She said, all good. Okay.

46
00:04:50.840 --> 00:04:54.639
Vikesh K: Then I Matt all good at your end regarding capstones.

47
00:04:57.780 --> 00:05:00.449
Vikesh K: I'm not sure if you can't speak right now. So

48
00:05:02.410 --> 00:05:11.760
Vikesh K: okay, cool. Yeah, I I would say, all of for all of you. Please focus more on the capstone now that we are towards the end, it's 50%, and it's mandatory.

49
00:05:12.130 --> 00:05:29.950
Vikesh K: And once you get done with this big chunk. So already, I believe many of you would have already been, you know, at least done some assignments there. So once you finish your capstone, 50%, plus the rest of the marks. You will clear the threshold. At least you will get your certificate. Then you can again come back later on, because you have access to the material for next one year.

50
00:05:30.270 --> 00:05:34.960
Vikesh K: so be more tactical at this stage, and all the best.

51
00:05:35.710 --> 00:06:04.120
Pooja: So 1 1 last question, even after the course. And do we have like now, we, whenever we got any query, we reach out to the program advisor, and we send request right? So after, like, I think, march somewhere, we are ending the course. So after that, do we have this privilege that we, if we, if we have any question or any discussion that we need we can raise the ticket and get the feedback also. Is this available or no?

52
00:06:04.120 --> 00:06:12.509
Vikesh K: So, pooja! What happens when a course run ends? So all the association of the learning facilitators and all they all. It also ends, we are moved to the next.

53
00:06:12.510 --> 00:06:13.040
Pooja: Okay.

54
00:06:13.190 --> 00:06:17.829
Vikesh K: Right. So unfortunately, what will happen with the course end? And whatever is the last

55
00:06:18.060 --> 00:06:23.440
Vikesh K: date or deadline for that? After that we it. The tickets won't be forwarded to us.

56
00:06:24.100 --> 00:06:24.550
Pooja: Okay.

57
00:06:24.550 --> 00:06:38.499
Vikesh K: But but what you can do, you know, many of us are connected on Linkedin. So maybe let's say if there's something. And you, you know. You have already built a wrap up with that program leader, and you can all always reach out to us on Linkedin. And then, you know, ask us questions, or have a discussion.

58
00:06:39.790 --> 00:06:41.129
Pooja: Okay. Okay. Thank you.

59
00:06:41.780 --> 00:06:42.530
Vikesh K: Coach.

60
00:06:43.360 --> 00:06:54.239
Vikesh K: Okay? Then we can call it a day. And my next officer, I believe, is on 13th of March again at this time so bit early. I'm sorry about that in advance.

61
00:06:54.530 --> 00:06:56.319
Vikesh K: but we'll see you

62
00:06:56.610 --> 00:07:03.780
Vikesh K: in the next office hour, and I think then again, because that would be towards the end, maybe we will again focus more on the capstone

63
00:07:04.160 --> 00:07:04.990
Vikesh K: and.

64
00:07:04.990 --> 00:07:09.139
shashi: Again. Time, time zone also, I mean, they would have changed, and

65
00:07:09.700 --> 00:07:14.820
shashi: I mean I mean the we would have switched back from the daylight, saving time to another.

66
00:07:15.020 --> 00:07:18.389
Vikesh K: So would it be more early for you folks, or would it be late.

67
00:07:18.666 --> 00:07:23.910
shashi: We will be. I think 1 h will be moving ahead. So yeah, it will be 1 h later.

68
00:07:24.160 --> 00:07:27.550
Vikesh K: Okay, okay, that's good. Then I hope so.

69
00:07:28.130 --> 00:07:36.089
Vikesh K: Yeah, okay, thank you. Thanks a lot, then, and we'll see you on 13. Then alright.
