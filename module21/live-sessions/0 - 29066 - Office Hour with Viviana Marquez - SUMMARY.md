  - Neural networks are ensembles of linear regressions
  - Networks transform complex data into linearly separable spaces

- **Architecture Components**:
  - Input layer: Size determined by number of features
  - Hidden layers: Arbitrary number and size
  - Output layer: Size determined by prediction task
  - Activation functions: Determine neuron output behavior

- **Implementation Differences**:
  - Deep learning requires manual architecture definition

class Net(nn.Module):
    def __init__(self):
        super(Net, self).__init__()
        self.fc1 = nn.Linear(4, 12)  # 4 input features, 12 neurons in first hidden layer
        self.fc2 = nn.Linear(12, 8)  # 12 neurons in first layer, 8 in second hidden layer
        self.fc3 = nn.Linear(8, 3)   # 8 neurons in second layer, 3 output classes

    def forward(self, x):
        x = F.relu(self.fc1(x))  # Apply activation function after first layer
        x = F.relu(self.fc2(x))  # Apply activation function after second layer
        return self.fc3(x)       # No activation on output (handled by loss function)
```

### GPU Selection
```python
# Check and select GPU
device = torch.device("cuda:0" if torch.cuda.is_available() else "cpu")
print(f"Using device: {device}")

# For Apple M1/M2/M3 Macs
device = torch.device("mps" if torch.backends.mps.is_available() else "cpu")
```

### CNN Implementation (LeNet-5)
```python
class LeNet5(nn.Module):
    def __init__(self):
        super(LeNet5, self).__init__()
        # First convolutional layer: 1 input channel, 6 output channels
        self.conv1 = nn.Conv2d(1, 6, kernel_size=5)
        # First pooling layer
        self.pool1 = nn.MaxPool2d(kernel_size=2, stride=2)
        # Second convolutional layer: 6 input channels, 16 output channels
        self.conv2 = nn.Conv2d(6, 16, kernel_size=5)
        # Second pooling layer
        self.pool2 = nn.MaxPool2d(kernel_size=2, stride=2)
        # Fully connected layers
        self.fc1 = nn.Linear(16 * 4 * 4, 120)
        self.fc2 = nn.Linear(120, 84)
        self.fc3 = nn.Linear(84, 10)

    def forward(self, x):
        x = self.pool1(F.relu(self.conv1(x)))
        x = self.pool2(F.relu(self.conv2(x)))
        x = x.view(-1, 16 * 4 * 4)  # Flatten
        x = F.relu(self.fc1(x))
        x = F.relu(self.fc2(x))
        x = self.fc3(x)
        return x
```

### Transfer Learning Example
```python

model = models.resnet18(pretrained=True)

# Freeze all parameters
for param in model.parameters():
    param.requires_grad = False

# Replace final layer for new classification task
num_features = model.fc.in_features
num_classes = 10  # For 10 classes in your dataset
model.fc = nn.Linear(num_features, num_classes)
```
