# Module 7 Office Hours Summary - Linear Regression

## Overview
- Introduction to first supervised learning model: Linear Regression
- Focus on practical implementation using Python and scikit-learn
- Demonstration using a simple student study hours vs. grades dataset

## Key Concepts Covered

### Types of Machine Learning Problems
- Classification problems (e.g., K-means from Module 6)
- Regression problems (predicting numerical values)
  - Examples: house prices, inventory forecasting, gold price prediction

### Linear Regression Fundamentals
- Based on two mathematical concepts:
  - Equation of a line
  - Ordinary least squares
- Types:
  - Simple Linear Regression (one input variable)
  - Multiple Linear Regression (multiple input variables)

### Implementation Steps
1. Data Preparation
   - Split data into input (X) and output (Y) variables
   - Divide into training (80%) and testing (20%) sets
   - Check for missing values and data quality

2. Model Training
   - Initialize linear regression model from scikit-learn
   - Fit model using training data
   - Model produces coefficients and intercept

3. Model Evaluation
   - Make predictions on test data
   - Calculate accuracy and error metrics
   - Compare training vs. testing accuracy (should be within 5-10% range)
   - Visualize results using plots

## Best Practices
- Always check for missing values before training
- Verify linear relationship between variables
- Split data into training and testing sets
- Evaluate model performance on both sets
- Use visualization to understand results

## Additional Notes
- Linear regression requires numeric data
- Data should have a linear relationship for best results
- Typical accuracy range: 75-85% in real-world applications
- Can apply transformations if data isn't naturally linear

## Q&A Highlights
- Discussion about data formats and pandas capabilities
- Questions about capstone project consultations
- Clarification on handling structured data and logs
- Future office hours (Module 11) will cover data cleaning in detail
