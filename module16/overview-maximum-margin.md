# Overview: Maximum Margin Classifier

An SVM creates two parallel hyperplanes that pass through the nearest data points. These nearest points are called support vectors, and the region between the support vectors is called the margin and is bounded by the two hyperplanes. These hyperplanes can be drawn in many different ways to classify the data. A hyperplane with the maximum margin is the most stable, and the margin indicates how far two classes are apart. In mathematics, the hyperplane with the highest margin is called the maximum margin hyperplane, and the classifier it defines is called the maximum margin classifier. Here is an illustration of the concept:
