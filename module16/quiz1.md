# Nonlinear Features Quiz

## Question 1 (1 point)
Which of the following is NOT the quadratic feature generated from 𝑥₀ and 𝑥₁ linear features?

**Options:**
1. 𝑥₁²
2. 𝑥₀+𝑥₁
3. 𝑥₀²
4. 𝑥₀⋅𝑥₁

**Answer:** 2 (𝑥₀+𝑥₁)
The sum of two linear features (𝑥₀+𝑥₁) is still a linear combination and not a quadratic feature. Quadratic features include squares (𝑥₀², 𝑥₁²) and cross-products (𝑥₀⋅𝑥₁).

## Question 2 (1 point)
What do nonlinear features indicate in ML?

**Options:**
1. They focus on data points that are easy to classify
2. They are ineffective when handling small portions of the data
3. They indicate linear relationships between variables
4. They are used to capture complex patterns and relationships in the data

**Answer:** 4
Nonlinear features are specifically designed to capture complex, non-linear patterns and relationships in the data that cannot be represented by simple linear combinations of features.

## Question 3 (1 point)
Which of the following are NOT nonlinear functions?

**Options:**
1. Point-slope function
2. Exponential function
3. Cubic function
4. Trigonometric function

**Answer:** 1
The point-slope function (y = mx + b) is a linear function as it represents a straight line. All other options (exponential, cubic, and trigonometric functions) are nonlinear.
