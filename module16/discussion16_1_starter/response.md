Task 1: Model Comparison

I have analyzed four classification models (Logistic Regression, Decision Tree, KNN, and SVM) based on their performance on a given dataset "telecom_churn.csv".

Model	Accuracy	Precision (False)	Recall (False)	F1-score (False)	Precision (True)	Recall (True)	F1-score (True)	Pros	Cons
Logistic Regression	79.01%	0.81	0.78	0.79	0.77	0.8	0.79	Interpretable, Fast to train	May not capture complex relationships well
Decision Tree	93.39%	0.96	0.91	0.93	0.91	0.96	0.93	Highly interpretable, Handles non-linear relationships effectively, Strong overall performance	Prone to overfitting
K-Nearest Neighbors	87.60%	0.99	0.77	0.86	0.8	0.99	0.89	Simple to implement	Slow, Sensitive to imbalanced data, Less interpretable
Support Vector Machine	92.51%	0.92	0.94	0.93	0.93	0.91	0.92	Effective for non-linear data	Can be slow to train, Less interpretable
Recommendation:

The Decision Tree emerged as the best model due to its highest accuracy (93.39%), good performance across classes, and excellent interpretability.

Task 2: Handwritten Digit Recognition

Assume we evaluate the models we created in task 1 using load_digits from sklearn based on performance results we got, for the suitability of the four models for recognizing handwritten digits.

Logistic Regression: Fast and interpretable, but may struggle with the non-linearity of image data.
Decision Tree: Interpretable but prone to overfitting and may not capture complex image patterns.
KNN: Slow to train and predict, less interpretable, and not suitable for high-dimensional data.
SVM: Highly effective for image classification due to its ability to handle non-linear relationships.
Recommendation:

For the handwritten digit recognition task, SVM is the most suitable model due to its strong performance with image data, despite being less interpretable.
