# Module 14 - Live Session 2 Summary

## Session Overview
This live session covered two main topics:
1. Guidance on capstone projects and creative approaches
2. Introduction to decision trees with hands-on practice

## Capstone Project Guidance

### Important Dates & Schedule
- Holiday break: December 22 - January 5
- Capstone problem statement due after the break
- Initial report due in Module 20
- Break week after initial report submission
- Deep learning topics (CNNs) covered in Module 22
- Natural Language Processing covered in Module 18

### Making Projects More Complex
1. **Multiple Model Approaches**
   - Using different algorithms (logistic regression, decision trees)
   - Comparing model performances
   - Using different features and analyzing their importance

2. **Two-Step Classification Example**
   - First classifier for initial categorization
   - Second classifier for subcategorization
   - Example: Plant disease detection
     * Step 1: Classify if plant has disease
     * Step 2: Identify specific disease type

3. **Feature Experimentation**
   - Testing different feature combinations
   - Analyzing feature importance
   - Comparing model performance with different feature sets

### Current Machine Learning Toolbox
- Exploratory Data Analysis
- Time Series Analysis
- K-Nearest Neighbors
- Linear Regression
- Logistic Regression
- Decision Trees

## Decision Trees Deep Dive

### Key Characteristics
- Supervised learning algorithm
- Used for both classification and regression
- Intuitive flowchart-like structure
- Nodes represent questions/decisions
- Branches represent outcomes
- Leaves are final predictions

### Applications
- Healthcare (diagnosis based on symptoms)
- Finance (loan approvals)
- Retail (customer segmentation)
- Education (student performance prediction)

### Hands-on Practice
- Dataset: Breast Cancer Classification
- Features: radius mean, smoothness, concavity
- Model achieved 90% accuracy with single feature
- Discussion of precision vs recall importance in medical context
- Emphasis on avoiding false negatives in medical diagnosis

### Advantages
- Easy to understand and interpret
- Handles both numerical and categorical data
- Good for feature importance identification

### Disadvantages
- Prone to overfitting
- Sensitive to small data changes
- Challenges with imbalanced data

## Key Takeaways
1. Start capstone project planning early, especially for deep learning/NLP projects
2. Consider creative ways to add complexity to projects through multi-step approaches
3. Focus on thorough documentation and analysis of different model approaches
4. Consider domain-specific requirements when evaluating model performance (e.g., false negatives in medical diagnosis)
