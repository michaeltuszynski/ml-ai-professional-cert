# Statistics and Probability Quiz 3

## Question 1 (1 point)
What is the maximum area under the curve between any two vertical lines in a continuous distribution?

**Options:**
1. The total area under the curve of a continuous distribution is always equal to 1
2. The area between any two vertical lines is greater than 0
3. The area under the curve between any two vertical lines in a continuous distribution can be 2
4. There is no limit to the area under the curve between any two vertical lines in a continuous distribution

**Answer:** 1 - The total area under the curve of a continuous distribution is always equal to 1

*Explanation:* A fundamental property of probability density functions is that the total area under the curve must equal 1 (100% probability). Since any area between two vertical lines must be a portion of this total area, it cannot exceed 1. This is a key axiom of probability theory that ensures probabilities are properly normalized.

## Question 2 (1 point)
Under what condition will the mean and median of a distribution be the same?

**Options:**
1. When the distribution is skewed to the left
2. When the distribution has outliers
3. When the distribution is skewed to the right
4. When the distribution is symmetric

**Answer:** 4 - When the distribution is symmetric

*Explanation:* In a symmetric distribution, the mean and median are equal because the distribution is perfectly balanced around its center point. This is a fundamental property of symmetric distributions like the normal distribution.

## Question 3 (1 point)
In what way does the variance of a distribution impact its graph?

**Options:**
1. A larger variance leads to a narrower and taller graph
2. A larger variance leads to a wider and taller graph
3. A larger variance leads to a narrower and shorter graph
4. A larger variance leads to a wider and shorter graph

**Answer:** 4 - A larger variance leads to a wider and shorter graph

*Explanation:* Variance measures the spread of data points from the mean. A larger variance indicates greater spread, resulting in a wider and shorter distribution to maintain the same total area of 1 under the curve.

## Question 4 (1 point)
What is the mathematical formula used to calculate the standard deviation?

**Options:**
1. The square root of the variance
2. The cube root of the variance
3. The sum of all samples divided by the number of samples
4. The same as the variance

**Answer:** 1 - The square root of the variance

*Explanation:* Standard deviation (σ) is defined as the square root of the variance (σ²). This relationship is fundamental in statistics and gives us a measure of spread in the same units as the original data.
