# Mini-Lesson 1.1: Overview of Machine Learning and Deep Learning Concepts

## Machine Learning vs Deep Learning

**Machine Learning (ML)** is like teaching computers to learn from experience. For example, if we want a computer to identify between two fruits—apples and bananas—we give the computer a dataset comprising the features of apples and bananas. The computer learns from this dataset to identify the two fruits.

**Deep Learning** is a special kind of ML. It is a more advanced and sophisticated way for computers to learn. In deep learning, we use neural networks, which are inspired by how our brains work. A neural network has layers of interconnected nodes. Each layer helps the computer to understand different features of the data. Given images of apples and bananas, the neural networks in deep learning would be able to identify the color, shape, and other features on its own to help differentiate the two fruits.

## Types of Learning

### Supervised Learning
Supervised learning is like learning from a teacher. The teacher guides your learning. Taking the same example of differentiating between apples and bananas:
- You are given a dataset with examples of fruits, each labeled with its name ("apple" or "banana")
- The ML algorithm uses this labeled data to learn patterns and differences
- The algorithm learns relationships between features (shape, color, size) and corresponding labels
- Once trained, the model can predict or identify new fruits

### Unsupervised Learning
In unsupervised learning, the algorithm explores the data to find patterns or groupings on its own. The algorithm might notice that some fruits are similar in certain ways and groups them together without being told what they are. Essentially, the algorithm discovers the structure or hidden relationships within the data without explicit guidance.

## Statistical Inference

### Descriptive Statistics
Involves summarizing and describing the main features of a dataset:
- Mean
- Median
- Mode
- Standard deviation

These help us understand and organize the characteristics of data.

### Inferential Statistics
Uses data from a sample to make inferences or predictions about a population. Key concepts include:

#### Core Components
- **Population**: The entire group of individuals or observations
- **Sample**: A subset of the population that is actually observed
- **Parameter**: Numerical value summarizing a population characteristic
- **Statistic**: Numerical value summarizing a sample characteristic

#### Hypothesis Testing
A statistical method for making inferences about population parameters:

- **Null Hypothesis (H0)**: Statement of no effect, difference, or change
- **Alternative Hypothesis (H1)**: The claim researchers are trying to find evidence for
- **Significance Level (α)**: Predetermined threshold for decision-making (common values: 0.05, 0.1, 0.01)
- **Confidence Interval**: Range of values within which a population parameter is estimated to lie
