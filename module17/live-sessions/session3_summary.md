# Live Session 3 Summary

## Key Points

### 1. Capstone Project Timeline
- Due date: March 19th
- Extensions available for 1-2 weeks if needed
- Recommendation to maintain momentum and complete within original timeline

### 2. Strategic Course Completion
- Focus on high-impact assignments:
  - Practical Applications
  - Capstone Project Part 1 & 2 (50% weightage and mandatory)
- Major components can help reach 70% of grade
- Knowledge checks and discussions (15%) are more straightforward
- Passing grade threshold: 75%

### 3. Practical Application 3 Importance
- Serves as template for final capstone project
- Emphasizes comparing multiple algorithms (No Free Lunch Theorem)
- Recommended minimum implementation:
  - XGBoost
  - Random Forest
- Thorough completion will facilitate capstone work

### 4. Technical Discussion
- Student concern: test accuracy (90%) close to dummy classifier (87%)
- Identified as class imbalance problem
- Discussion interrupted before full explanation

### 5. Student Concerns
- Timeline concerns between practical application and capstone
- Instructor's perspective: "if you sweat more in training, you will bleed less in the war"

## Session Focus
The session primarily addressed strategic planning for course completion and emphasized the critical role of Practical Application 3 as preparation for the capstone project.
