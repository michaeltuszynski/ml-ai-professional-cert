# Module 17 Live Session Summary
Date: January 2024
Instructor: Jessica

## Key Points

### Module 17 Overview
- Module 17 is a practical application assignment focused on comparing classifiers
- No new videos, audio assignments, or knowledge checks
- Last practical application before the capstone project
- Important opportunity to practice before capstone submission

### Assignment Details
- Dataset: Portuguese banking institution marketing campaign data
- Task: Binary classification to predict if a customer subscribed to the service
- Focus on comparing different classification algorithms:
  - K-nearest neighbors
  - Logistic regression
  - Decision trees
  - Support vector machines

### Important Guidelines
1. **Data Analysis**
   - Perform preliminary analysis
   - Check correlations between variables
   - Clean the data
   - Choose baseline model
   - Select appropriate input/output variables

2. **Model Comparison**
   - Apply multiple classification algorithms
   - Use cross-validation
   - Implement grid search for hyperparameter tuning
   - Note: Dataset is likely unbalanced
   - Focus on appropriate metrics (not just accuracy)
   - Consider confusion matrix, precision, recall, F1 score

3. **Visualization Requirements**
   - Create meaningful visualizations beyond basic plots
   - Ensure axes are labeled
   - Include legends where needed
   - Focus on insights that help understand the data
   - Consider relationships between variables (e.g., job status and marital status)

### Project Structure
- Required components:
  1. README file with:
     - Summary of findings
     - Link to notebook
  2. Jupyter notebook
  3. Data files
  4. Clear directory structure
- Recommendation: Keep all work in one notebook for clarity

### Evaluation Metrics
- Focus on appropriate classification metrics
- Don't rely solely on accuracy due to unbalanced data
- Consider:
  - Confusion matrix
  - Precision
  - Recall
  - F1 score

### Best Practices
1. Follow the rubric carefully
2. Write clear, non-technical findings
3. Remove unnecessary files before submission
4. Ensure visualizations provide meaningful insights
5. Consider real-world implications when analyzing data

### Course Timeline
- Course end date: March 19th
- Extensions available up to 6 months
- Learning facilitator grading until April 2nd
- Recommended to submit before April 2nd for instructor grading

## Additional Notes
- This assignment serves as practice for capstone project
- Focus on clear communication of findings
- Consider practical implications when analyzing data
- Use hypothesis testing and A/B testing where appropriate
