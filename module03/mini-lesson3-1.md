## Example Application: House Price Prediction

### Business Understanding
As mentioned above, CRISP-DM starts with understanding a business problem. One such example of a business problem could be estimating the sale prices of houses. Imagine the client in this example is interested in predicting house prices based on a couple of features of the house‚Äînamely, square footage and the year the house was built. To be more precise, you could boil this project down to the following three business questions:

1. What is the square footage of the house?
2. What year was the house built?
3. Can the price of a house be predicted based on these two features with reasonable accuracy?

### Data Understanding and Preparation
In this phase, you need to understand and prepare your data. Suppose you have the following data to work with:

| Price        | Square Footage | Bedrooms | Bathrooms | Stories | Guest Room | Basement | Hot Water | Air Conditioning | Parking | Preferred Area | ZIP Code |
|-------------:|--------------:|:--------:|:---------:|:-------:|:----------:|:--------:|:---------:|:---------------:|:--------:|:-------------:|:--------:|
| ?            | 7,420         | 4        | 2         | 3       | No         | No       | No        | Yes             | 2        | Yes           | 90210    |
| 12,250,000   | 8,960         | 4        | 4         | 4       | No         | No       | No        | Yes             | 3        | No            | 90094    |
| ?            | 9,960         | 3        | 2         | 2       | No         | NaN      | No        | No              | 2        | Yes           | 90077    |
| 12,250,000   | 7,500         | 4        | 2         | 2       | No         | Yes      | No        | Yes             | NaN      | Yes           | 90245    |
| 11,410,000   | 7,420         | 4        | 1         | 2       | Yes        | Yes      | No        | Yes             | 2        | NaN           | 90003    |
| ?            | 7,500         | 3        | 3         | 1       | No         | Yes      | NaN       | Yes             | 2        | Yes           | 90002    |
| 10,150,000   | 8,580         | 4        | 3         | 4       | No         | No       | No        | Yes             | NaN      | Yes           | 90001    |
| 10,150,000   | 16,200        | 5        | 3         | 2       | No         | No       | No        | No              | 0        | No            | 90001    |

It is important to remember that the data you have may not contain all of the information needed to predict prices accurately. Historically, features such as 'bedrooms' and 'bathrooms' have been a predictor of price, but in this case, the client wants to predict house prices based on square footage and/or the year a house was built. Since this data does not include the year each house was built, you should first make predictions based on the square footage. The far-left column is the predicted price based on this feature. The data contains missing values such as "NaN," which signals to you that data cleaning is necessary.

### Modeling
Next, you have to choose a model for your data. In this case, a linear regression model can predict house prices based on the features outlined in the dataset. The following is an example: Given the square foot (ùëìùë°¬≤) of a house for which the price is unknown, regression will analyze the linear relationship between price and square footage to make the prediction. Therefore, the linear equation for predicting house prices based on square footage might look something like the following:

```
price = ùëò‚ÇÄ + ùëò‚ÇÅùëìùë°¬≤
```

### Evaluation
Finally, you have to evaluate the performance of the linear regression model. Root mean squared error (RMSE) is the most commonly used measure to assess regression models. It is the average of the squared difference between each predicted price and the actual price.

## Why Is CRISP-DM Important to a Data Scientist?

Among a variety of other reasons, the CRISP-DM framework is important to data scientists because it:

1. Includes several processes that take care of simple data-mining tasks
2. Promotes best practices and facilitates the replication of projects
3. Provides a uniform framework for planning and managing projects
4. Is a cross-industry standard to be used by any data science project, regardless of its domain
