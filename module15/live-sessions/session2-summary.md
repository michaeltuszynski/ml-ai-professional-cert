# Live Session 2 Summary - A/B Testing and Experimentation

## Overview
This session focused on A/B testing and experimentation, a crucial skill for data scientists and product roles in tech companies. The instructor (Vikesh) chose this topic due to its practical importance in industry, despite not being directly covered in the course curriculum.

## Key Topics Covered

### Introduction to A/B Testing
- A/B testing is used to establish cause-and-effect relationships in product changes
- Essential for product development, feature launches, and measuring impact
- Different from observational studies which only show correlation
- Used across industries (tech companies, pharmaceuticals, social policy)
- Also known as "Randomized Controlled Trials" in some fields

### Industry Applications
- Companies like Netflix, Google, Meta, Amazon extensively use A/B testing
- Examples discussed:
  - Netflix testing autoplay timing (5s vs 10s vs 15s)
  - Google testing different shades of blue for optimal user engagement
  - Website layout and UI changes testing
  - Machine learning model deployment testing

### Key Components of A/B Testing
1. Control Group (existing version)
2. Treatment Group (new version)
3. Pre-defined metrics for measurement
4. Statistical analysis to determine significance

### Case Study Walkthrough
- Online news portal example
- Metrics analyzed:
  - Time spent on page
  - Conversion rates
  - User preferences
