# Module 15 - Live Session 1 Summary: Gradient Descent

## Administrative Updates
- Last office hour before holiday break
- Emeritus holiday break: December 24th - January 1st
  - No program support, tickets, or office hours during this period
- Important reminder to book one-on-one consultations for Capstone project discussions
  - Book with section-specific learning facilitator
  - If no available times, open support ticket for accommodation
  - Critical for getting project approval before starting

## Technical Content: Gradient Descent

### Overview
- Most popular optimization strategy in machine learning and other fields
- Key advantages:
  - Simple implementation
  - Efficient computation
  - Works well with complicated functions
  - Effective at finding optimal parameters to minimize error

### Key Components
1. **Function Components**
   - Objective function (what we want to optimize)
   - Gradient (array of partial derivatives)
   - Starting point
   - Learning rate (step size)
   - Number of iterations

2. **Types of Gradient Descent**
   - Batch Gradient Descent
     - Uses average of gradients from all training examples
     - Good for simple/convex functions
     - Efficient but requires more memory

   - Stochastic Gradient Descent (SGD)
     - Updates parameters one training example at a time
     - More computationally efficient
     - Faster convergence for large datasets

   - Mini-batch Gradient Descent
     - Combines batch and stochastic approaches
     - Splits data into small batches
     - Balances computational efficiency and speed

### Implementation Considerations
1. **Starting Point Selection**
   - Critical for convergence
   - Poor selection can lead to:
     - Divergence
     - Finding local instead of global minima
     - Requiring more iterations

2. **Learning Rate**
   - Small learning rate:
     - Safer but slower convergence
     - May require more iterations

   - Large learning rate:
     - Faster but risk of overshooting
     - May never reach minimum

### Practical Implementation
- Available in scikit-learn:
  - SGDRegressor
  - SGDClassifier
  - Various specialized implementations for different algorithms
- Can be used to improve existing models when other optimization methods fail
- Requires hyperparameter tuning (learning rate, iterations)

## Next Steps
- Module 16 begins in the new year
- Approximately 2.5 months remaining in the course
- Focus on Capstone project preparation during the break
