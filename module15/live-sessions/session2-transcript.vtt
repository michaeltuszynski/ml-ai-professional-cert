1
00:00:01.480 --> 00:00:13.379
Vikesh K: Alright, so welcome! Up to the office, and this is this is still in that week gradient different. But I I what I gather, what I understood is this

2
00:00:13.520 --> 00:00:42.039
Vikesh K: had started way before, you know, holiday breaks, or December 18, so I believe you might have had a good amount of time to go through it. It's more mathematical in nature. The gradient is. And all those things that's sort of like the backbone of the algorithms that we have, because to to optimize them, you know how to figure out the minimum or maximum. That's the process and quite mathematical in nature. But there's another topic. And I thought, because there's a

3
00:00:42.180 --> 00:00:47.429
Vikesh K: big gap and all of you are fresh. So I want to talk about another topic, which is

4
00:00:47.970 --> 00:01:08.970
Vikesh K: very important from a practical perspective. But it's not really covered in the course, although we would talk about it. But we won't really go through it in detail. And I want to do that, especially if you're in any product product role, or you want to make it shift, or you want to work as a data scientist. Often you might have. This is a part of your role.

5
00:01:09.200 --> 00:01:12.630
Vikesh K: And what I want to talk about is a B testing and experimentation.

6
00:01:13.461 --> 00:01:27.180
Vikesh K: There are 2 things I want to give you an overview. Maybe many of you are new to Ab ab testing experimentation, and then we will do one case study, and I'm I would later supplement some more case studies, so that for all of you

7
00:01:27.605 --> 00:01:40.470
Vikesh K: to practice, and especially if you're looking for roles. Let's say you know you, you look for typical roles in the industry. Ab. Testing is a very, very crucial skill. A lot of my work is about Ab testing, we do a lot of experimentation.

8
00:01:40.470 --> 00:02:02.019
Vikesh K: So it's important that you understand this, and where it fits in with machine learning. Essentially, ab testing is, you can think it's applied statistics. So the basics of stats that you do hypothesis testing, then within that T test and over, and all those things that's basically is involved in Ab testing. So it's a very important topic. And then, once you have an understanding of this, so

9
00:02:03.090 --> 00:02:09.579
Vikesh K: you would cover 2 parts. One is the machining part. One is the applied stats part. So at least you will have an overview of the same.

10
00:02:10.470 --> 00:02:18.249
Vikesh K: Okay edits in the chat. Cool. Do you know anyone what? What? This is?

11
00:02:23.050 --> 00:02:24.030
Vikesh K: Any clue?

12
00:02:29.460 --> 00:02:32.760
Vikesh K: I will give you a hint. This is a series on Netflix.

13
00:02:36.263 --> 00:02:42.269
Vikesh K: Nice, and that's great. Yes, so this was a. This was a fascinating series. They wanted to understand

14
00:02:42.420 --> 00:03:06.399
Vikesh K: how your the kind of food you take, how it impacts. I think your body and other metrics that are of importance. Right? But the challenge is, if they give you a let's say, if I get a vegetarian diet, and you get a non-vegetarian diet, and they compare us. That won't be a right comparison. Because we 2, we 2 would have a very different genetic structure. Right? So what they did, they

15
00:03:06.730 --> 00:03:09.219
Vikesh K: found out these identical twins.

16
00:03:10.340 --> 00:03:12.350
Vikesh K: And you know, with the assumption that

17
00:03:12.500 --> 00:03:26.639
Vikesh K: the genetic makeup, genetic structure of these identical twins the same. So one was given a you know, the meat based diet, the other was given, I believe, a Vegan diet, and then they started understanding how it impacts their body.

18
00:03:26.710 --> 00:03:43.350
Vikesh K: Okay, so many of you know, many of us simply debate about the kind of food. So that's what they wanted to do. So the whole series is about that. And I think the name is called, you are what you eat. Okay? So the basic idea being, they did an experimentation to establish cause and effect.

19
00:03:43.480 --> 00:03:49.309
Vikesh K: And that's why experimentation is very important when you have to establish a cause and effect

20
00:03:49.480 --> 00:03:55.729
Vikesh K: rather than you know when you, when you can be sure that a causes. B, you have to do an experiment.

21
00:03:56.680 --> 00:03:59.989
Vikesh K: And that's what was done in this study.

22
00:04:00.690 --> 00:04:01.599
Vikesh K: So in

23
00:04:01.960 --> 00:04:13.150
Vikesh K: usually, what we have been doing is something called observation study. You know, you have the past data. And using that, you are building the machine learning models. That's an observation study all right.

24
00:04:13.300 --> 00:04:16.029
Vikesh K: The main point is, you can only

25
00:04:16.588 --> 00:04:27.709
Vikesh K: focus on correlation there. Essentially, whatever insights you get you, you figure out the predictive modeling and all those things. But essentially, it's a correlation which you can infer from that

26
00:04:27.870 --> 00:04:30.140
Vikesh K: right experiment

27
00:04:30.824 --> 00:04:42.250
Vikesh K: allow you to establish causality. And that's very important. So what you. And one of the main distinction and experimentation is, you basically set up the whole thing

28
00:04:42.920 --> 00:04:47.099
Vikesh K: you intervene into the process. You randomly divide people into groups.

29
00:04:47.240 --> 00:04:49.810
Vikesh K: and they would see only one change.

30
00:04:50.120 --> 00:04:54.079
Vikesh K: And then you note down the matrix on which the changes are measured.

31
00:04:54.240 --> 00:04:59.679
Vikesh K: And with the help of that, you basically figure out, you know whether that one particular change

32
00:05:00.212 --> 00:05:08.529
Vikesh K: made an impact or not. Right? That's the whole scenario about. So the main thing. Why you use experimentation or a B testing is because

33
00:05:08.750 --> 00:05:14.810
Vikesh K: you can establish a causation. And this can be very helpful when you are improving your products.

34
00:05:15.010 --> 00:05:25.880
Vikesh K: So, for example, what kind of ui should I use? What kind of languages should I use? These are the things which are heavily tested before they are rolled out in front of the customers.

35
00:05:27.660 --> 00:05:41.289
Vikesh K: in the industry it's called a B testing a very simple scenario. Here, you can see you usually have something which you want to test. In this case it was the layout. How the website looks like, you can see this is different

36
00:05:41.640 --> 00:05:44.720
Vikesh K: compared to this. And also the color is different.

37
00:05:45.110 --> 00:06:12.130
Vikesh K: The how you measure the impact is, you might have a key metric. In this case this was conversion rate. So if 100 people came, how many converted to the next stage? All right. So in this case, 25 people, 25% of the people converted 5% of people converted in B variant. So as a product manager, once you do the analysis and come up with this, you will go ahead with version A, because that allows you to increase your conversion rate.

38
00:06:12.340 --> 00:06:19.839
Vikesh K: So all the companies do these small iterative experiments to improve the product quality.

39
00:06:20.628 --> 00:06:30.259
Vikesh K: I think in Google, this is. This is at the start, but but forgot the details of it. But Marisa Mayor, who later on moved to Yahoo.

40
00:06:30.510 --> 00:06:34.180
Vikesh K: She once had a debate with the designer

41
00:06:34.300 --> 00:06:37.700
Vikesh K: on which color which shade of blue to choose.

42
00:06:38.200 --> 00:06:42.320
Vikesh K: They tested around some thousands of shades of blue.

43
00:06:42.430 --> 00:06:51.850
Vikesh K: and they tested it, using a B testing. So they wanted to figure out which will make people, you know, search even more. So that's how companies have been doing it.

44
00:06:52.130 --> 00:06:59.940
Vikesh K: I will give you 2 particular examples. One is Twitter now X and booking.com. So my company does a lot of experiments

45
00:06:59.960 --> 00:07:22.219
Vikesh K: like each of my team. Each of the teams are booking at a given time would have 4 or 5 experiments running, and each of the vertical had multiple experiments running. So overall, we do a lot of experimentation company wide. That's how we test the products. In fact, booking is, you know, one of the very well known companies in the experimentation space, especially in Europe.

46
00:07:22.400 --> 00:07:31.009
Vikesh K: In us there are many Google, Meta, Airbnb. They are very, very good at experimentation, and most of the job involves experimentation. Even Amazon.

47
00:07:32.400 --> 00:07:42.029
Vikesh K: And one example of how it looks like, okay. So Netflix, again, very good. Big on experimentation. I want you to tell me what thing they are experimenting here.

48
00:07:49.620 --> 00:07:56.039
Vikesh K: It's so. If it's the the bottom part is not completely sure.

49
00:07:59.190 --> 00:08:01.615
Ravi Duvvuri: You know the transactions, I think,

50
00:08:02.630 --> 00:08:06.069
Ravi Duvvuri: whether to do sign up or buy directly or.

51
00:08:07.150 --> 00:08:07.910
Vikesh K: Yes.

52
00:08:08.280 --> 00:08:18.440
Vikesh K: So if you see all the different pages and this is taken, I've taken this from their blog. This is called call to action, so call to action is, they have changed it.

53
00:08:18.720 --> 00:08:26.160
Vikesh K: So each rest of the page remains the same. Only one thing which they have changed is the call to action. So this is something which companies keep doing. So they

54
00:08:26.614 --> 00:08:44.480
Vikesh K: you have a copywriter. You want to see what entices people to take an action. So before it's rolled out, it's a b tested. You make a design change before it's rolled out. You do an Ab testing. So ab testing is is the way by which all these companies do it. All right.

55
00:08:45.880 --> 00:08:52.560
Vikesh K: I went to Linkedin. I picked up some couple of job profiles. Expedia Amazon

56
00:08:53.102 --> 00:08:57.620
Vikesh K: tick, tock, data, analyst product sign product, manager data scientist, each one of them

57
00:08:57.780 --> 00:09:00.529
Vikesh K: highlight that you need to know experimentation.

58
00:09:00.840 --> 00:09:11.130
Vikesh K: All right. So that's that's 1 of the reasons I highlighted here. Even in machine learning. For example, what happens? Let's say you have a you design a new ranking algorithm.

59
00:09:11.340 --> 00:09:16.829
Vikesh K: So you go to amazon.com, you search for a product. You get a listings all right.

60
00:09:17.180 --> 00:09:23.169
Vikesh K: How? And you have different machine learning algorithms to decide on the ranking.

61
00:09:23.740 --> 00:09:33.380
Vikesh K: So you have, let's say, machine learning model, one machine learning model 2. The question becomes, then, which model should you choose? When when you

62
00:09:34.290 --> 00:09:45.030
Vikesh K: roll it out for ranking right? Which ranking is better for the from a customer's perspective, because each ranking have will have its own criteria. So what usually is done. It's a b tested.

63
00:09:45.140 --> 00:09:49.040
Vikesh K: You know, the machine learning model outputs are a B tested and then seen.

64
00:09:49.150 --> 00:09:56.079
Vikesh K: which output gives you a better impact on the matrix that you care about, and

65
00:09:56.400 --> 00:09:58.450
Vikesh K: that's rolled out to the customers.

66
00:09:59.310 --> 00:10:05.949
Vikesh K: Okay? So even in machine learning so when you deploy models, when and those models

67
00:10:07.290 --> 00:10:11.750
Vikesh K: are customer facing you do AV testing before you roll it out.

68
00:10:12.350 --> 00:10:13.160
Vikesh K: Okay.

69
00:10:13.610 --> 00:10:21.889
Vikesh K: any. I know this is new topic but but like, like, I said, this is this is very important one that way. So I want you to know about it

70
00:10:21.990 --> 00:10:27.419
Vikesh K: any questions or doubts. So far I also wanted to show you one thing before we move to the case study.

71
00:10:27.760 --> 00:10:29.819
Vikesh K: but I can't do.

72
00:10:29.970 --> 00:10:30.740
Vikesh K: There you go.

73
00:10:31.600 --> 00:10:36.770
Vikesh K: I wanted to show you about the most hot company right now we're just opening a

74
00:10:37.720 --> 00:10:39.679
Vikesh K: I hope I'm able to open this

75
00:10:43.900 --> 00:10:45.380
Vikesh K: any questions so far.

76
00:10:46.300 --> 00:10:50.890
Vikesh K: I know. Maybe I I caught all of you off guard with the new topic.

77
00:10:51.400 --> 00:10:53.839
Vikesh K: But I think this would be more

78
00:10:55.120 --> 00:11:13.100
Vikesh K: okay. I'm not able to open this. But if you can open this at your end. This is again one of the hottest company right now. Openai automating all our jobs Sam Altman gave the latest blog so. But when they are hiring. And they have this. They have this data scientist product

79
00:11:13.280 --> 00:11:18.349
Vikesh K: opening. And if you are not able to open this, but if you check this listing.

80
00:11:18.946 --> 00:11:24.080
Vikesh K: They talk about knowing ab testing and experimentation. Okay? So

81
00:11:24.210 --> 00:11:31.780
Vikesh K: you pick up any hot company any of these companies to which have a very fancy product. They will be doing a lot of a testing experience.

82
00:11:32.220 --> 00:11:33.859
Vikesh K: It becomes very important.

83
00:11:34.150 --> 00:11:35.979
Vikesh K: Okay, Ravi has put this.

84
00:11:37.810 --> 00:11:41.290
Ravi Duvvuri: I was able to open it. So I just copied that

85
00:11:41.940 --> 00:11:45.010
Ravi Duvvuri: the A B testing piece of it alrighty.

86
00:11:45.890 --> 00:11:54.380
Vikesh K: Yeah. So again, so that that's 1 of the reasons. Any product company, any Google opening, you check any Meta opening Netflix opening

87
00:11:55.040 --> 00:12:16.519
Vikesh K: unless until it's like A, you know, a totally software engineer back. And even in software engineering, you, you need to know A B testing because you design. This, you know the back end. Oh, sorry. The front end often to work with the experimentation team. Okay? So so from that perspective, Ab, testing is very important. And one of the things you should be aware about, especially if you wish to.

88
00:12:16.936 --> 00:12:22.950
Vikesh K: You know, apply for roles. Move into a data scientist position, or don't go into a data, heavy position.

89
00:12:23.610 --> 00:12:26.350
Vikesh K: cool any questions or doubts so far on this.

90
00:12:28.240 --> 00:12:29.999
shashi: No, not at the moment, probably

91
00:12:30.430 --> 00:12:34.050
shashi: along the way. Probably you get come up with some questions. I think.

92
00:12:34.730 --> 00:12:36.480
Vikesh K: Okay, cool sounds good.

93
00:12:36.970 --> 00:12:41.919
Vikesh K: Okay? So then I will share a simple notebook with all of you.

94
00:12:42.200 --> 00:12:43.020
Vikesh K: Let me

95
00:12:50.250 --> 00:12:51.489
Vikesh K: just a second.

96
00:13:01.830 --> 00:13:12.539
Vikesh K: So I'm gonna give you an overview we will solve. Try to solve the problem together, just to give you an understanding of how what this kind of problems look like. And what's being done there? Okay.

97
00:13:13.340 --> 00:13:15.330
Vikesh K: can you see my screen right now?

98
00:13:18.070 --> 00:13:18.740
Ravi Duvvuri: Yes.

99
00:13:20.270 --> 00:13:26.440
Vikesh K: Cool. So I've already pasted these things which which we talked about. Now this company.

100
00:13:28.540 --> 00:13:31.869
Vikesh K: there are a few more people joining it. Okay, this this

101
00:13:32.060 --> 00:13:55.970
Vikesh K: case study is a simple one. Obviously, they have slightly more complication in a B testing. In fact, a B testing as a topic can be quite vast. There are now dedicated companies which allow you to do A B testing. So one of the quick ways to learn the practical side of Ab testing is maybe reading their blogs some of these companies I can write down here. It's called stats.

102
00:13:57.080 --> 00:14:04.380
Vikesh K: That's Hig. If I remember that correctly double bw.

103
00:14:04.880 --> 00:14:16.719
Vikesh K: and echo, okay, so if you're curious, just go through their blog, and you know you will get an understanding of how companies are using. You'll be testing all of these people who started this company

104
00:14:17.010 --> 00:14:20.810
Vikesh K: stats folks. I think they used to work at Facebook

105
00:14:21.210 --> 00:14:23.300
Vikesh K: Echo. I'm not sure, maybe, Echo.

106
00:14:25.510 --> 00:14:36.099
Vikesh K: But these people they used to work in different companies, they realize, oh, Ab, testing is can be given out as a service. Many companies don't know how to do it. And they started companies around it.

107
00:14:36.200 --> 00:14:57.330
Vikesh K: Okay, so let's focus on, look at this simple case study. There is an online news portal which aims to expand its business by acquiring new customers. Every visitor to the website takes a certain action based on their interest. The company plans to analyze these interest and wants to determine whether a new feature will be effective or not. Right? So typically, this is how most of the

108
00:14:58.387 --> 00:15:00.210
Vikesh K: A B testing

109
00:15:00.700 --> 00:15:28.979
Vikesh K: problem statements look like you want to test out something new. You don't know whether it's good for customers or not, so what you will do. You will launch it on a sample of customers. See how they behave. If they behave positively you'll roll it out for the rest of the customers. Okay, so same thing with the what a Openai would be doing now with how people interact with the chat bots, what kind of results they're getting. I'm not sure if you have seen. But if you use chat, gpt off late.

110
00:15:29.090 --> 00:15:34.910
Vikesh K: they sometimes give you 2 outputs, and then they ask you which output was better. A or B,

111
00:15:35.340 --> 00:15:49.169
Vikesh K: okay, so right now what they're doing there. I think they're collecting a lot of survey data. In that sense. They're directly asking the customers which output was better. Mostly they are being generated from slightly different variations of data of the model.

112
00:15:49.320 --> 00:15:56.100
Vikesh K: And then, once they get enough data points, they will roll out the one which is more favorable to the customers.

113
00:15:56.530 --> 00:15:57.370
Vikesh K: Okay.

114
00:15:57.954 --> 00:16:12.489
Vikesh K: so 100 users are divided equally into 2 groups. The old landing page is served to the 1st group, which is called often called the control group in which you show them things as status quo, and the new landing page is served to the second group, which is the treatment group

115
00:16:12.870 --> 00:16:24.419
Vikesh K: and the different data points are collected. So what you have to do in this case study is explore the data set, you know. Do the Eda do users spend more time on the new landing page compared to the old?

116
00:16:24.590 --> 00:16:30.330
Vikesh K: What is the conversion rate about converted status depending on the language

117
00:16:30.490 --> 00:16:32.680
Vikesh K: and couple of other questions. Okay?

118
00:16:32.790 --> 00:16:34.429
Vikesh K: So I've also given a

119
00:16:35.602 --> 00:16:47.550
Vikesh K: again, I don't know why nothing is opening now. It's for opening again, a good book to read about Ab testing. If you're curious, all right, especially if if you plan to apply for data roles.

120
00:16:47.680 --> 00:16:49.670
Vikesh K: these kind of things might be helpful.

121
00:16:50.830 --> 00:16:54.000
Vikesh K: Alright. So let's go back to the

122
00:16:54.490 --> 00:16:57.889
Vikesh K: data set. I will show you the simple data set so far.

123
00:16:59.900 --> 00:17:01.599
Vikesh K: Let me zoom in.

124
00:17:02.460 --> 00:17:05.300
Vikesh K: This is a simple 1. 50

125
00:17:06.099 --> 00:17:13.359
Vikesh K: a hundred data points. You have groups often in A B testing. You will have a group column which will tell you

126
00:17:13.810 --> 00:17:29.749
Vikesh K: whether the customer was in the control group or in the treatment group. Okay, Treatment Control group is the status quo, you know, if you have a page you will show it as it is, treatment would be a new page, all right. So, for example, that the diagram which I showed you.

127
00:17:29.900 --> 00:17:38.139
Vikesh K: this might be a control group, or this might be a new page. This might be a control group. All right. And then you compare the matrix

128
00:17:39.270 --> 00:17:41.050
Vikesh K: sounds good. So far any.

129
00:17:44.210 --> 00:17:49.810
Vikesh K: Matt, I will come to your question. Any any other respect to this, so far?

130
00:17:52.790 --> 00:17:57.709
Vikesh K: No cool devil says, fine. Okay.

131
00:17:57.820 --> 00:18:12.240
Vikesh K: so you have landing. All the control group will have a old landing page. All the treatment will have the new landing page, so as a customer, as as a business. Now, what you care about, especially if you're a used website is how much time people are spending on your web page.

132
00:18:12.440 --> 00:18:35.549
Vikesh K: Because if they're spending more time A, that means they are finding the content relevant. And B, maybe you can also show them more ads, because this is one of the things which companies care about how much people are spending time on your websites. That's 1 of the reasons why Facebook Tiktok are so hot properties from an advertisement perspective, because people are spending hours and hours on that

133
00:18:35.620 --> 00:18:46.609
Vikesh K: converted? No? Yes, you know. Did they take some subscription? And if they had any, preferred languages? So now you can take the same thing, and you can slice and dice it by different angles.

134
00:18:46.800 --> 00:18:58.560
Vikesh K: Okay, so 1st quick check duplicated missing values. No, nothing is there. So then, what you have to do is you have already looked at the data I can.

135
00:19:01.460 --> 00:19:06.230
Vikesh K: We can due types.

136
00:19:07.120 --> 00:19:09.780
Vikesh K: If you feel lost, let me know.

137
00:19:10.390 --> 00:19:15.619
Vikesh K: Oh, I will repeat things. Okay.

138
00:19:19.730 --> 00:19:22.360
Vikesh K: taking all the columns.

139
00:19:27.980 --> 00:19:42.190
Vikesh K: Okay, so I'm I'm I was just trying to see the unique values in each one of them. So all the objects. They have 2 unique values except language preferred. There are 3 languages within there. Okay, if you check Df dot

140
00:19:44.230 --> 00:19:50.400
Vikesh K: oops, these are your objects, and you can actually do a maybe a

141
00:19:54.980 --> 00:19:59.250
Vikesh K: rooms list.

142
00:20:05.690 --> 00:20:11.560
Vikesh K: I will call it got list.

143
00:20:13.390 --> 00:20:14.720
Vikesh K: Then I can do.

144
00:20:30.520 --> 00:20:32.219
Vikesh K: Let's see if this works.

145
00:20:51.713 --> 00:20:55.830
Vikesh K: Okay. So you. You will see I'm I'm running the loop, but

146
00:20:56.293 --> 00:21:00.289
Vikesh K: the loop is running, but I'm able to see only the

147
00:21:00.820 --> 00:21:04.860
Vikesh K: the language preferred side. Do you know what's the reason for it, anyway?

148
00:21:11.720 --> 00:21:13.560
Vikesh K: So she you're saying something. But you weren't.

149
00:21:15.142 --> 00:21:18.850
shashi: It's being overwritten by the next variable. That's plot.

150
00:21:19.610 --> 00:21:29.769
Vikesh K: Yeah, yes, lovely. So that's what happens in the map. It overwrites it. So one way you can do it is you put Plt dot show so

151
00:21:30.040 --> 00:21:36.470
Vikesh K: hopefully with that, it will recreate all right every time. So now you have multiple

152
00:21:37.028 --> 00:21:43.299
Vikesh K: values, multiple charts. Now, okay, just remember this, this often happens, and if you run a for loop

153
00:21:43.440 --> 00:21:59.130
Vikesh K: for a for a, for a image, so control and treatment equally divided, 50 50 landing page. Again, because controlling treatment equally divided, converted, you have a different level. Maybe you can figure out the what I can do is

154
00:21:59.980 --> 00:22:04.480
Vikesh K: I can normalize this. So we'll we'll we will get the percentages

155
00:22:04.890 --> 00:22:16.140
Vikesh K: rather than the absolute number. All right, 50, 50 conversion rate. This would be maybe around 40, 55. This is, let's say, around 45. Okay, so there is a change in the conversion rate.

156
00:22:16.260 --> 00:22:17.920
Vikesh K: Language preferred.

157
00:22:18.571 --> 00:22:28.050
Vikesh K: What is the ratio of distribution? How many Spanish, French, and English, all right. So the main question which they want you to answer is the

158
00:22:28.320 --> 00:22:29.540
Vikesh K: time spent?

159
00:22:29.660 --> 00:22:34.839
Vikesh K: Okay, and time spent? You can look at as an individual column.

160
00:22:35.040 --> 00:22:39.570
Vikesh K: So this run this first.st

161
00:22:41.400 --> 00:22:44.530
Vikesh K: Okay? So this is the time spent. But what you

162
00:22:44.660 --> 00:22:49.019
Vikesh K: remember, you have 2 versions of the page there all right.

163
00:22:49.230 --> 00:22:52.789
Vikesh K: and you can also have this as a histogram, for example.

164
00:22:55.650 --> 00:22:56.450
Vikesh K: Well.

165
00:22:58.900 --> 00:23:07.019
Vikesh K: I hope this is his plot. Yes, okay. So this is the overall distribution. But what you care about are the landing pages?

166
00:23:07.500 --> 00:23:16.269
Vikesh K: Right? So you see, this is the blue one is the old new is the orange one. So this is the landing page difference

167
00:23:16.540 --> 00:23:18.550
Vikesh K: now, based on this.

168
00:23:18.760 --> 00:23:23.959
Vikesh K: Do you think we should? The company can go ahead for the new landing page?

169
00:23:35.720 --> 00:23:38.560
Vikesh K: Any guess? Or how would you like.

170
00:23:40.000 --> 00:23:44.360
shashi: We are spending less time on the page. The new.

171
00:23:44.360 --> 00:23:46.939
Harish: On the new page. They're spending less time right.

172
00:23:48.270 --> 00:23:53.839
shashi: Yeah, probably ads showing ads may not be. They may not be able to see the ads.

173
00:23:55.040 --> 00:23:56.689
Vikesh K: So what we can do, we can also.

174
00:23:57.730 --> 00:24:04.976
Vikesh K: we can basically quantify this. So let's say, I group by landing page right? And

175
00:24:06.030 --> 00:24:20.680
Vikesh K: then I focus on time spent right trying to me. And

176
00:24:34.050 --> 00:24:38.630
Vikesh K: oh, that'll be doing the syntax. I keep forgetting.

177
00:24:41.390 --> 00:24:43.590
Vikesh K: Okay, let me 1st show you the main. Only

178
00:24:45.560 --> 00:25:02.129
Vikesh K: right. So for the mean for the new, the mean is around 6.2 2. So this is around 6 point. I believe both of them are normally distributed. So this will be around 6.2 2, and for the old this is around 4.5. All right.

179
00:25:03.140 --> 00:25:04.923
Vikesh K: So do you think?

180
00:25:06.770 --> 00:25:14.120
Vikesh K: So Dahlil says. Yes, the new landing page cool others. Do you do? Do you think this is? Make this make sense.

181
00:25:16.360 --> 00:25:18.720
Anu.Arun: Yeah, we need the area under the curve.

182
00:25:19.270 --> 00:25:20.040
Vijay Chaganti: Yeah.

183
00:25:24.040 --> 00:25:28.880
Anu.Arun: What's the what's the standard deviation? So the total time is still the same.

184
00:25:30.760 --> 00:25:33.649
Vikesh K: Yes, standard deviation is another parameter which will

185
00:25:35.480 --> 00:25:44.390
Vikesh K: right? So if you check the and oh, I think, yeah, oh, yeah, that's that's

186
00:25:47.770 --> 00:25:51.990
Vikesh K: yes. So you have the s 2D. Values as well.

187
00:25:53.790 --> 00:25:58.229
Vikesh K: The old one has a higher standard deviation compared to the new one.

188
00:25:58.950 --> 00:26:02.460
Vikesh K: Okay? And you can see, because this is wider, right?

189
00:26:03.840 --> 00:26:07.090
Vikesh K: So now here things become interesting. So

190
00:26:07.200 --> 00:26:14.960
Vikesh K: on the face of it, the new one has a higher time spent compared to the old one, but there is also an overlap between the 2.

191
00:26:16.070 --> 00:26:18.999
Vikesh K: So if you see this area

192
00:26:19.330 --> 00:26:23.980
Vikesh K: where the blue and the orange one, so there is no clear demarcation between the 2.

193
00:26:24.850 --> 00:26:37.629
Vikesh K: Right? It's it's 1. 1 simple example is let's say, you know you, you want to measure the height of people, and you think you know the the claim is Dutch people people from Netherlands. They are the tallest.

194
00:26:37.780 --> 00:26:44.730
Vikesh K: so you will pick up randomly, pick up 100 people from Netherlands, you will randomly pick 100 people from us and measure their height

195
00:26:44.970 --> 00:26:53.239
Vikesh K: alright. On an average, maybe the Dutch people are taller, but there would be an overlap between the numbers. So how can you be sure?

196
00:26:54.280 --> 00:26:59.499
Vikesh K: Right? And especially when you're making this product when you are launching this product.

197
00:26:59.660 --> 00:27:04.009
Vikesh K: remember, you just have access right now, access only to 100 people.

198
00:27:04.880 --> 00:27:12.010
Vikesh K: And your your website might be having, let's say, thousands of 1 million, or maybe tens of thousands of people coming every day.

199
00:27:12.290 --> 00:27:15.139
Vikesh K: So that's where the stats part comes into picture.

200
00:27:15.520 --> 00:27:21.370
Vikesh K: What you are doing right now is you're taking a sample data, and you're making claims about the population.

201
00:27:21.930 --> 00:27:24.909
Vikesh K: That's what the whole inferential statistics is about.

202
00:27:25.490 --> 00:27:30.839
Vikesh K: Right? So what you would do. This is the initial numbers which you have. But

203
00:27:30.950 --> 00:27:33.330
Vikesh K: you know this can be by fluke as well.

204
00:27:33.580 --> 00:27:51.910
Vikesh K: By chance you may get a you know. Let's suppose only those new customers, the 50 customers which were in the new page by chance. They happen to spend more time. Okay? Because you can never be sure you have. Let's say, 10,000 people coming to a website on a daily basis.

205
00:27:52.170 --> 00:27:57.979
Vikesh K: 100 people came 50. You show them the new page 50. You showed them the old page.

206
00:27:58.130 --> 00:28:05.489
Vikesh K: and by chance these 50 people were, let's say, loyal customers to your website, and they spend more time.

207
00:28:06.740 --> 00:28:10.129
Vikesh K: So how do you figure out, hey? Whether this overlap

208
00:28:10.999 --> 00:28:19.919
Vikesh K: is because of some chance, or you know, there is a clear distance differentiation between the 2 behaviors.

209
00:28:20.030 --> 00:28:25.990
Vikesh K: That's that's where and that's where things become tricky. And here, effectively. Machine learning can't really help you.

210
00:28:26.450 --> 00:28:31.140
Vikesh K: You have limited sample data. So what you need is the stats.

211
00:28:31.510 --> 00:28:37.309
Vikesh K: That's where applied stats comes into picture. It will be able to tell you with some certainty

212
00:28:37.500 --> 00:28:45.019
Vikesh K: whether you, whether this difference is significant or not, does that make sense any questions or doubts?

213
00:28:46.320 --> 00:29:15.510
Vikesh K: By the way, this is the same way by which medicines are tested, you know. Let's say, when they came up with a new Corona vaccine. Obviously they can't give it to everyone in the world right? Because you haven't tested it. You don't know how people react to it. So you get a sample people. You give them. One gets a placebo version, one gets a proper vaccine. They measure those people. The performance of the different health metrics. If they think the difference is significant enough.

214
00:29:15.520 --> 00:29:19.749
Vikesh K: The FDA approves the drug or the vaccine, and then it's rolled out in the market.

215
00:29:19.910 --> 00:29:22.500
Vikesh K: So the process remains the same in a way.

216
00:29:24.240 --> 00:29:25.406
Vikesh K: Okay? And

217
00:29:26.430 --> 00:29:53.029
Vikesh K: in case someone is interested in social policy, in economics, this is called randomized controlled trial. This is what won the Nobel Prize in 2019. Okay, so this is used across social sector. This is used in medicine. This is used in companies. Just the name changes all right in companies in product companies. It's called a B testing. And when you do it in Pharma field, and when you do it in social sector, you call it randomized control trial.

218
00:29:53.460 --> 00:29:56.120
Vikesh K: Okay? Any points or questions so far here.

219
00:29:59.850 --> 00:30:02.979
Vikesh K: Okay, so what we will do in this case.

220
00:30:04.486 --> 00:30:09.340
Vikesh K: We will 1st take out the old you know

221
00:30:09.520 --> 00:30:16.319
Vikesh K: the time spent on the old page and the time spent on the new new page. Okay? So if you see the time, new

222
00:30:16.520 --> 00:30:24.480
Vikesh K: data which I've collected. This is all the data spent on the new page, all right. And if you see the time old.

223
00:30:25.730 --> 00:30:27.510
Vikesh K: this is all the data.

224
00:30:29.720 --> 00:30:52.220
Vikesh K: All the time spent on the old page. All right. You have these 2 things, and what you do. There is a T test, all right. Now. I won't really go into the theory and all those things, because that will take another session on its own. But I just want you to be aware about it. What? Essentially you will do is something called T test. What T-test does is if you have 2 groups

225
00:30:52.580 --> 00:30:53.850
Vikesh K: and you want to

226
00:30:54.010 --> 00:31:05.490
Vikesh K: measure whether the numeric that you're measuring the the number that you are trying to figure out if the difference is statistically significant. Okay, so whenever you have

227
00:31:05.710 --> 00:31:08.629
Vikesh K: a group like this, so you have an old group.

228
00:31:08.980 --> 00:31:10.600
Vikesh K: and you have a new group.

229
00:31:11.010 --> 00:31:14.379
Vikesh K: Alright. And here what you care about is time spent

230
00:31:15.000 --> 00:31:22.300
Vikesh K: right in those 2 things, and you want to measure whether the time spent is statistically significant.

231
00:31:22.830 --> 00:31:35.149
Vikesh K: The difference is statistically significant or not. You do a T test. There is some variation within T-test. You do a couple of other tests. But that's what essentially the whole stats is about. If you have a let's say

232
00:31:35.800 --> 00:31:39.990
Vikesh K: 3 groups, you will do something else. The test will change.

233
00:31:40.220 --> 00:32:03.700
Vikesh K: Okay, it's called a nova. But you don't really. You just need to know about it right now. Obviously, you know, read more about it later on. But the test will change. So this is very much like a machine learning. In that sense. When you have classification, you do different kind of classification test depending on the what kind of scenario it is. When you have regression, you have a different test. Different machine learning algorithm model. Same here, you have a test.

234
00:32:03.830 --> 00:32:09.579
Vikesh K: And the whole test is about, hey, this is the large data set. I just have a sample.

235
00:32:10.470 --> 00:32:14.850
Vikesh K: Can I take the sample data and make claims about the whole population.

236
00:32:15.860 --> 00:32:31.560
Vikesh K: In my very 1st session I had once talked about the big picture of stats when we were talking about distribution. I'm not sure how many of you remember. But essentially, that's what you're trying to do here. You're taking these 50 data points. And from this 50 data points. You're trying to make a claim about the whole population.

237
00:32:31.800 --> 00:32:32.650
Vikesh K: all right.

238
00:32:32.760 --> 00:32:39.480
Vikesh K: and within that. So you use a library called Scipy within this, which I have, I think.

239
00:32:41.560 --> 00:32:57.549
Vikesh K: Yes, you. You have a statistical library called Scipy within, like you have scikit-learn for machine learning. Most of the statistical tests that you do are from sci-fi. Alright. So if you, if you're, you know, working in the data center, this is something you will use a lot along with the scikit-learn.

240
00:32:57.860 --> 00:33:04.330
Vikesh K: and you call out the test within it. Same procedure. You pass the 2 data sets, which is

241
00:33:06.760 --> 00:33:17.910
Vikesh K: this is one basically procedural step. But essentially the main thing that you should be concerned about is this test, which is called the T test of independent values. You pass on the new

242
00:33:18.230 --> 00:33:21.110
Vikesh K: column, which is time new time, old

243
00:33:21.583 --> 00:33:27.530
Vikesh K: a couple of other things here, and don't worry about that. You can ask Chatgpt what this is about.

244
00:33:28.003 --> 00:33:33.609
Vikesh K: So then the the main thing which comes out is the interpretation of the result.

245
00:33:33.720 --> 00:33:34.530
Vikesh K: Okay.

246
00:33:36.820 --> 00:33:50.620
Vikesh K: here what it? The test says. So this is the function which I have defined, which is, interpret the test results when you run this and you pass the data set. You know the test that you ran. It says there is a significant difference in the meantime spent

247
00:33:51.092 --> 00:34:02.379
Vikesh K: between the old page and the new page. Okay, so what essentially is saying? The gap that you saw here which is around, I believe, 2 min, or something. Now less than 2 min.

248
00:34:03.260 --> 00:34:06.990
Vikesh K: Confirm 6.2 2 minus 4.5 3

249
00:34:07.250 --> 00:34:17.399
Vikesh K: 1.6 8 9. Okay, so what this is saying, this gap that you saw 1.6 8 min between the 2 groups is significant, and hence you should roll out this product.

250
00:34:17.870 --> 00:34:28.939
Vikesh K: If you're a product manager, if you're a data scientist, you will give you will give the green light for the project and the company can the the front end guys can change the new layout to the new?

251
00:34:29.100 --> 00:34:31.730
Vikesh K: Okay, so this is how things will be done.

252
00:34:32.080 --> 00:34:38.539
Vijay Chaganti: So if this is not a positive change, then that number will be minus 1 point something, and then we don't know.

253
00:34:39.310 --> 00:34:53.049
Vikesh K: Can happen. Sometimes you come up with a new thing, and you think, oh, customers may gonna love it, and they they actually don't love it, and you know, the the time spent might decrease. Then obviously, you're not gonna rule out the change.

254
00:34:53.710 --> 00:34:58.550
Vikesh K: And again, you will 1st check whether that whether the difference that you see is by fluke

255
00:34:58.880 --> 00:35:00.560
Vikesh K: or not by fluke.

256
00:35:01.260 --> 00:35:30.880
Vikesh K: So so you know, one thing is, how many of you like this? Officers? Right, all of you. The people who come to this office are more or less random. You there are 12 of you, maybe I, 13 of yeah, 12 of you right now. Maybe I do it on tomorrow again, some 12 more people will come. Okay. Today, maybe I get an approval rating of 60%. Tomorrow I might get an approval rating of 40. So then the statisticians are filled out. When you have a small data, how can you make claims about the big population.

257
00:35:31.160 --> 00:35:34.959
Vikesh K: Alright. So that's these are the scenarios in which this is helpful.

258
00:35:37.660 --> 00:35:39.149
Vikesh K: Does that make sense?

259
00:35:39.680 --> 00:35:41.850
Vikesh K: I I hope I haven't recorded

260
00:35:42.620 --> 00:35:50.239
Vikesh K: so it scared you. But from my perspective, you ask me, this is a very important topic which I believe many of you are looking for jobs, or might be

261
00:35:50.650 --> 00:35:54.977
Vikesh K: want to move into data oriented road. This is good to know

262
00:35:55.890 --> 00:36:03.429
Vikesh K: So so hopefully, you know. And then I can give you more case studies to practice with. Along like, like what we have been doing with the machine learning part.

263
00:36:04.390 --> 00:36:05.010
Vikesh K: Okay?

264
00:36:05.010 --> 00:36:06.370
shashi: See now even the

265
00:36:06.560 --> 00:36:15.509
shashi: movie screening. When the movie is being released, the project 30 million in the 1st weekend, 50 million in second weekend and all the project is this what they also

266
00:36:15.850 --> 00:36:23.140
shashi: use, or how do they? I mean, even for viewership? They are expecting so many people to come, and things like that? Do they use something like this.

267
00:36:24.200 --> 00:36:25.200
Vikesh K: Oh.

268
00:36:25.810 --> 00:36:42.159
Vikesh K: I'm not sure, although I do know about this thing. You know this this thing. I'm not sure this movie released 30 million. But, Netflix, if you have watched series on Netflix, do you remember they they have this auto play.

269
00:36:42.480 --> 00:36:52.769
Vikesh K: They have ex. They actually experimented a lot on what should be the ideal autoplay, whether it should be 5 second cap, 2 second gaps, 10 second cap. In fact, this was a

270
00:36:53.530 --> 00:36:59.070
Vikesh K: this was a thing written on a let me quickly give me one second. I can. I can show that

271
00:36:59.190 --> 00:37:01.510
Vikesh K: I will update in the slides.

272
00:37:01.900 --> 00:37:06.030
Vikesh K: But these all these things are being tested by the

273
00:37:06.300 --> 00:37:09.639
Vikesh K: scientists. You know, for example, what should be the ideal

274
00:37:11.360 --> 00:37:14.150
Vikesh K: runtime between the different things. Just give me.

275
00:37:15.180 --> 00:37:19.519
shashi: Especially for binge watching. I think they let the next episode start immediately.

276
00:37:21.360 --> 00:37:31.920
Vikesh K: They do all these? Because, again, these are the things which machine learning can't really give you an answer, because what you need to figure out is a causal relationship. Okay.

277
00:37:32.850 --> 00:37:36.900
Vikesh K: if you make it 5 seconds, does that lead to a better

278
00:37:37.040 --> 00:37:39.659
Vikesh K: watch time, or compared to some other one?

279
00:37:40.490 --> 00:37:42.740
Vikesh K: Let me just to you.

280
00:37:51.800 --> 00:37:53.789
Vikesh K: And meanwhile, if you have any questions.

281
00:37:58.220 --> 00:38:00.050
Vikesh K: can you see the screen? Yeah.

282
00:38:01.020 --> 00:38:04.310
Vikesh K: So so this was a guy who had written it on

283
00:38:05.300 --> 00:38:26.850
Vikesh K: I can use. And I happen to read this, and I saved this. So their key. Metrics were attention and hours watch. So always, whenever you do this, you focus on some key metric. And they, I believe they have written here. So they tested for 5 seconds, 10 seconds, 15 seconds, 10 seconds caused the biggest increase in hours. Watched.

284
00:38:26.970 --> 00:38:42.429
Vikesh K: We thought it gave people time to digest what they had just watched, but wasn't too fast. 5 seconds where it become jarring? Interestingly. So then they rolled out with 10 seconds at least. The story which this guy mentions. Okay, he was a dev who built the netflix auto flare technology.

285
00:38:42.790 --> 00:38:43.690
Vikesh K: So

286
00:38:44.430 --> 00:38:50.640
Vikesh K: so whether you are in on software side product manager side ab testing as a skill can be very crucial.

287
00:39:03.070 --> 00:39:05.729
Vikesh K: no doubts. Okay. So I think

288
00:39:06.100 --> 00:39:08.820
Vikesh K: there was one question asked by.

289
00:39:10.990 --> 00:39:12.860
Ravi Duvvuri: I have one question.

290
00:39:13.500 --> 00:39:13.930
Vikesh K: So.

291
00:39:16.524 --> 00:39:23.620
Ravi Duvvuri: So the product manager, right? Like, if data scientist, Ml, engineer and these guys do the job like.

292
00:39:24.000 --> 00:39:31.639
Ravi Duvvuri: especially in the data science space or in Ml. Space. What would be the role of product manager there.

293
00:39:31.800 --> 00:39:37.139
Ravi Duvvuri: I know, for other traditional softwares, I'm aware, like, you know, they are responsible for building the product.

294
00:39:37.500 --> 00:39:42.270
Ravi Duvvuri: But when it comes to, you know this Ml. Space.

295
00:39:43.470 --> 00:39:51.720
Vikesh K: Okay. So usually, I how I can tell you so at least, maybe how it happens that you know, most of the product companies is you set the direction of the product.

296
00:39:52.670 --> 00:40:12.090
Vikesh K: So in a way, product managers like at least how it works in my team and a couple of other teams. That booking is. You work with the designers you work with the researchers. You work with the data folks. You try to understand 1st of all, what your product is about, what should be that? What? What is that direction it should take, how it should evolve.

297
00:40:12.220 --> 00:40:15.789
Vikesh K: and how customers, what are the features which customers want.

298
00:40:16.160 --> 00:40:23.290
Vikesh K: So you come up with different hypothesis that you need to order different features that your product should have, and then you work with the team to roll it out.

299
00:40:23.500 --> 00:40:28.540
Vikesh K: So, for example, let's say, you know let me let me do.

300
00:40:30.620 --> 00:40:46.369
Vikesh K: Yes. So, coming back to the example, let's say you have to measure the height between Dutch people and the Us. People. If I just give you 2 sample, you know, 2 Dutch people and 2 American people, and you measure the height between them. And you say, oh, maybe American people are tall. That can be a wrong conclusion.

301
00:40:46.710 --> 00:40:47.500
Vikesh K: 2

302
00:40:49.670 --> 00:41:01.129
Vikesh K: statistically confirm that. Yes, the difference between the height is significant. You need good amount of sample size, and how much sample size do you need? That will depend on the population and everything

303
00:41:01.320 --> 00:41:28.350
Vikesh K: so often. We have experiments running for weeks, and that will depend on what kind of thing we want to test and how long. You know what are the other customers are behaving there? Couple of other things. There are some more nuances. But yeah, the gist is essentially this is this is like a very simplified version of this. But hopefully, this will give you an idea of what kind of things can be checked. Now, the second thing I want you to check is the conversion rate.

304
00:41:28.630 --> 00:41:34.639
Vikesh K: So the conversion rate, if you check between the 2 groups that should also id differ.

305
00:41:34.890 --> 00:41:39.960
Vikesh K: see if I have the data same, it's got handy.

306
00:41:44.810 --> 00:41:49.579
Vikesh K: Oh, no. Once again, this is a different one. Yeah, this is.

307
00:41:50.940 --> 00:41:53.159
Vikesh K: you have the conversion rate here.

308
00:41:53.360 --> 00:42:21.900
Vikesh K: Yes, converted yes or no. You have to convert this into one and 0, and then you figure out the conversion rate, and then you see whether the conversion rate. So there are multiple metrics that you care about. Right? One is the time spent. The other one is the conversion rate. So the other thing you have to check is the conversion rate. So maybe try this at your end and see if you can. You know, figure out whether the conversion rate between the 2 is different or not. Right? You can use obviously use chat Gpt for this at this stage, because this is not something you've done.

309
00:42:22.685 --> 00:42:26.980
Vikesh K: But but this would could be a good exercise.

310
00:42:29.040 --> 00:42:34.559
Vikesh K: Matt is asking, okay, scrum. Has you got any metrics at all?

311
00:42:37.030 --> 00:42:57.610
Vikesh K: No, no, we have a proper. There are company wide metrics that we have to choose. Matt. Every team has different metrics that they focus on. It could be funnel progression. So let's say, people move from one stage of the buying process to different stage. It could be funnel progress. It could be final. Conversion. Conversion is typically the main thing

312
00:42:58.189 --> 00:43:03.899
Vikesh K: which many companies care about. So, for example, in this page

313
00:43:04.110 --> 00:43:20.439
Vikesh K: which I showed you the example which I showed you for Netflix, they would care about how many people get converted as a customer, whether they sign up, whether they join the community right? So the matrix are pre-decided. You never decide metrics after the experiment. It's always before the experiment you have to.

314
00:43:20.630 --> 00:43:35.499
Vikesh K: Otherwise anyone can do some hacking. Okay, you run an experiment, see which matrix are good. And then you say, Hey, these metrics are good. That means experiment is successful. No. So you basically pre decide on the matrix how you would evaluate it, and then you run the experiment.

315
00:43:36.880 --> 00:43:38.629
Vikesh K: I hope that answers your question.

316
00:43:39.220 --> 00:43:41.720
Vikesh K: Cool any other points.

317
00:43:46.830 --> 00:43:53.590
Vikesh K: I hope I know we didn't talk about the stuff which is there in the course. But I hope this is useful.

318
00:43:53.780 --> 00:44:06.430
Vikesh K: and and at least gives you some some interesting thing to check and explore at your own free time definitely read more about a B testing the main guy. If you really want to know it well.

319
00:44:06.670 --> 00:44:10.989
Vikesh K: is a person called Roan Kohavi. He's he's sort of

320
00:44:11.517 --> 00:44:22.839
Vikesh K: the top guy for a B testing. He's also written very good book on this so he's considered as sort of the god of a B testing, and especially for a product company. So if you are

321
00:44:23.480 --> 00:44:30.759
Vikesh K: thinking of doing experimentation, learning more about it, he has bunch of videos on Youtube, you can go through that that could be helpful.

322
00:44:31.230 --> 00:44:37.910
Vikesh K: And I will maybe give out some more case studies in case you want to practice Pb, testing.

323
00:44:38.700 --> 00:44:39.510
Vikesh K: Okay?

324
00:44:40.510 --> 00:44:44.319
Vikesh K: But before that, any other questions doubts. You have.

325
00:44:47.410 --> 00:44:52.179
Matt Lee: Hey, Vikash? Yeah, I do have a quick question. So I'm just trying to kind of like picture

326
00:44:52.410 --> 00:44:54.650
Matt Lee: myself in a professional environment. Right?

327
00:44:54.790 --> 00:44:57.880
Matt Lee: So like, I guess

328
00:44:58.660 --> 00:45:06.460
Matt Lee: these things are kind of planned way in advance. And then you know what metrics you can get. You can start to kind of like programming ahead of time, even before you get the results.

329
00:45:07.506 --> 00:45:10.530
Matt Lee: And then how? And then you're typically given like

330
00:45:11.380 --> 00:45:15.520
Matt Lee: a timeline is kind of based on how difficult the project is, or like,

331
00:45:17.990 --> 00:45:19.529
Matt Lee: yeah, I guess. Like what

332
00:45:20.680 --> 00:45:29.811
Matt Lee: I guess. Like trying to try and picture your daily life of like you get some data, and then they give you like, a usually like a month to work on it. Or you have to report every 2 weeks.

333
00:45:30.240 --> 00:45:32.670
Matt Lee: just trying to picture your workload.

334
00:45:32.670 --> 00:45:51.630
Vikesh K: So so it will depend. So, for example, let's say, when you when you do an A B test, when you launch an A B test. Often you have to. You let it run for a couple of weeks before you can figure out, you know, look into the data. So typically what happens in an A B test. There is a work at the start, and there is a work at the end.

335
00:45:52.040 --> 00:45:55.400
Vikesh K: Usually there is not much work in the middle.

336
00:45:56.310 --> 00:46:02.370
Vikesh K: But then, what's what's happening is you have as a team, you run multiple Ab tests. So let's say,

337
00:46:03.310 --> 00:46:24.920
Vikesh K: in one experiment, you might be doing that work before you start the experiment in another project you might be working on a project on an experiment at towards the end. Right? So this is how you basically, that's on the Ab testing side. That's more or less the regular thing because our team does a regular work on experiments. The other part is the

338
00:46:25.180 --> 00:46:27.160
Vikesh K: maybe, if you have some ad hocs.

339
00:46:27.490 --> 00:46:31.549
Vikesh K: or if you have some projects which which is given timeline to you. So, for example.

340
00:46:35.190 --> 00:46:39.019
Anu.Arun: Time curve, let's say, of unemployment rate.

341
00:46:39.430 --> 00:46:50.640
Anu.Arun: Okay? And then, now you below, you have another sine curve, which is, let's say, the weather. You know, it's another time series.

342
00:46:51.570 --> 00:46:52.320
Vikesh K: Okay.

343
00:46:52.670 --> 00:46:57.350
Anu.Arun: So you, yeah, the period and the amplitude would be different.

344
00:46:57.490 --> 00:47:05.839
Anu.Arun: And then, yeah, so this something. And then you know, another factor below this thing or we, and then, now you take slices of this

345
00:47:06.830 --> 00:47:12.789
Anu.Arun: so so you can draw a line in the time axis like perpendicular. Then you take.

346
00:47:14.532 --> 00:47:16.289
Vikesh K: Let's say, this is inflation. Okay.

347
00:47:16.290 --> 00:47:16.620
Anu.Arun: Yeah.

348
00:47:16.620 --> 00:47:17.599
Vikesh K: And then what you're saying.

349
00:47:17.600 --> 00:47:21.039
Anu.Arun: And then, if you take a slice of the data now, like, if you.

350
00:47:21.040 --> 00:47:23.009
Vikesh K: So so you're focused on this period.

351
00:47:23.010 --> 00:47:30.059
Anu.Arun: Yeah, no, no, I'm saying. I'll take. I'll randomize it. I'll take over the entire.

352
00:47:31.500 --> 00:47:36.230
Vikesh K: No it ideally when you do time series. So they should follow the same structure. Right? So if.

353
00:47:36.230 --> 00:47:38.996
Anu.Arun: No, no, no! I'm saying

354
00:47:40.170 --> 00:47:47.189
Vikesh K: By slices here, I mean, is like you pick up the data from, let's say, Jan to July of a particular year is, does that make sense. That's what you're trying.

355
00:47:48.020 --> 00:47:55.950
Anu.Arun: No, I wasn't thinking that I was thinking I would randomize it like I would take data from

356
00:47:57.600 --> 00:48:04.665
Anu.Arun: like, if you draw many like, if you sample this basically and and create

357
00:48:06.320 --> 00:48:07.720
Vikesh K: Training test in this.

358
00:48:09.040 --> 00:48:19.040
Anu.Arun: No. So let's say, okay, let's say T, equal to, let's say the period on. Let's say the axis of the YX axis is 100 like one month.

359
00:48:20.400 --> 00:48:24.479
Anu.Arun: Let's say that that's the unit via X. Access is time, and it's 1 month.

360
00:48:24.480 --> 00:48:24.840
Vikesh K: This.

361
00:48:24.840 --> 00:48:28.620
Anu.Arun: Now, let's say I take data every 10 months.

362
00:48:29.950 --> 00:48:30.970
Vikesh K: Okay, you take this

363
00:48:30.970 --> 00:48:37.910
Vikesh K: every time. Every. So so then, I'm taking data, I'm I'm and then making a new.

364
00:48:40.560 --> 00:48:47.540
Anu.Arun: a table which will be my new data and I will use. I won't use time series. I will use

365
00:48:48.170 --> 00:48:49.949
Anu.Arun: decision tree for that.

366
00:48:50.420 --> 00:48:53.059
Anu.Arun: So I'm generating my data this way.

367
00:48:53.670 --> 00:48:57.780
Vikesh K: Okay, so, but but for that matter, you you can even do it like this. That.

368
00:48:57.780 --> 00:48:58.140
Anu.Arun: No.

369
00:48:58.140 --> 00:49:06.749
Vikesh K: You have this data. Let's say you have data from Jan. This is, hold your data from Jan to December. You pick up only half of it. You pick up from Jan to October.

370
00:49:07.210 --> 00:49:22.080
Vikesh K: all right, and you build a model and you can make a decision tree model with this data. And then you test it on the rest of the data. You don't even have to randomly take it. So provided this is like a time series data, right. So within time series randomization becomes a problem, because

371
00:49:22.180 --> 00:49:42.320
Vikesh K: the Time series is supposed to have some station, some cyclical nature in their cyclical in nature, and there is a seasonality and all those things. So the way you can approach it is you have this data, for as you train, you have this data as test, and you can apply decision tree here and see the output which it gets you.

372
00:49:44.070 --> 00:49:45.480
Vikesh K: Does that make sense.

373
00:49:46.580 --> 00:50:01.790
Anu.Arun: Yeah, yeah, yeah, no. I understand. Instead of randomizing. Yeah, yeah, yeah, understood. Yeah. But this makes sense. This, this thing makes sense. So conversely, put like I could just do unemployment just extrapolate that unemployment right

374
00:50:02.240 --> 00:50:12.500
Anu.Arun: like. So I could. Just not you. So I could take the unemployment date the 1st curve. And if I project that further, that's what I want. Ideally, that's the goal.

375
00:50:13.380 --> 00:50:17.009
Vikesh K: Correct. So you. So this is unimpression, and this is not correct.

376
00:50:17.010 --> 00:50:25.677
Anu.Arun: Yeah, that would have been yeah. It's something like that would have been my output if I just take Arima or something, and I'm guessing that would give me something like that

377
00:50:25.940 --> 00:50:33.400
Vikesh K: So anup. In any case, what you will, you will try to fit this with the time series. So essentially, it's more like the regression problems that we will have

378
00:50:33.650 --> 00:50:44.947
Vikesh K: only thing which will matter is in plain regression. Where there is no time series. You randomly divide the data into train and test splits right? But in time series you have to be

379
00:50:45.800 --> 00:50:57.299
Vikesh K: conscious of the fact that you know the data has some autocorrelation on all those things going on. So typically how you divide the data is, you take the data from Jan to October. Then you try to predict. For let's say November to December.

380
00:50:57.530 --> 00:51:02.469
Vikesh K: Okay? And this prediction model part, you can use any of the regression models there.

381
00:51:02.790 --> 00:51:22.290
Vikesh K: Why, in theory, we have time series. Because well, you know initially when the models were developed. These were the linear regression models, and then the statisticians figured out. The linear regression model is not good for time series. Time series need a specific set of models. So they came up with these Arimas and other things, because the nature of the data is different.

382
00:51:22.420 --> 00:51:24.092
Vikesh K: But having said that

383
00:51:24.620 --> 00:51:33.130
Vikesh K: exeboost works pretty well, for example, or random forest works pretty well with time series data as well, because it's able to capture those patterns.

384
00:51:33.240 --> 00:51:34.100
Vikesh K: So

385
00:51:34.460 --> 00:51:42.300
Vikesh K: when you divide data like this, then you can either use your Arima Sarima, or whatever you want, plus the exipuse, the random forest.

386
00:51:43.570 --> 00:51:44.939
Vikesh K: Does that make sense.

387
00:51:45.830 --> 00:51:49.250
Anu.Arun: Okay, I'm not familiar with random Forest. But okay,

388
00:51:49.630 --> 00:51:50.970
Vikesh K: And we will study so, so.

389
00:51:50.970 --> 00:51:51.450
Anu.Arun: Yeah, yeah.

390
00:51:51.450 --> 00:51:52.010
Vikesh K: Good.

391
00:51:52.140 --> 00:51:54.309
Vikesh K: We covered decision tree in this course. Right?

392
00:51:54.700 --> 00:51:58.860
Anu.Arun: Yeah, I think we did that. Yes, that that we.

393
00:51:58.860 --> 00:52:12.279
Vikesh K: Yeah, I don't think I thought, but after decision, tree there, we will basically talk about random forest. And then something called exit boost. These are one of the most powerful methods out there.

394
00:52:12.400 --> 00:52:16.560
Vikesh K: Okay, so so you will cover this in the course, and then you can try these methods as well.

395
00:52:17.070 --> 00:52:42.280
Anu.Arun: Okay. So my basic question was like, so you know, if you want to just project unemployment, we can do what you just did right. And the 1st one versus if I want to see other factors that can play which might not have been taken. If I want to correlate unemployment with weather and inflation. Whatnot is this a logical way to do it? Yeah.

396
00:52:42.280 --> 00:53:00.429
Vikesh K: Yeah, yes. By the way, others, if you want to drop off, feel free or if you have any questions, I can stay back. But coming back to Anu to your question. So what you would do is a very simple way. So you will have unemployment. You will need to create this data set unemployment. Let's say you collect this at a monthly level same, you would have inflation.

397
00:53:00.460 --> 00:53:20.159
Vikesh K: You would have what other you wanted, whether all right. You put all those features, but they should be at the same timestamp. For for example, you can't have inflation at a weekly level when you have employment at a monthly level, right? But once you do that, so you you will prepare a regular normal data set.

398
00:53:20.460 --> 00:53:25.940
Vikesh K: and then you take a 1st half of this data set. You use this as trained.

399
00:53:26.220 --> 00:53:36.839
Vikesh K: and then put this here, and like the second half is used as a test. But how you prepare the model will. How you prepare the data will look like a normal tables that we have.

400
00:53:38.270 --> 00:53:39.290
Anu.Arun: Understood? Yeah.

401
00:53:39.860 --> 00:53:41.290
Vikesh K: If this is not okay.

402
00:53:41.290 --> 00:53:43.829
Anu.Arun: This makes sense. It's not stupid, or I'm not.

403
00:53:43.830 --> 00:53:48.660
Vikesh K: No, no, ma'am, so this is this is what essentially all the people at Federal Reserve are doing. Right?

404
00:53:48.780 --> 00:54:00.260
Vikesh K: So yeah, this is, you go to Federal Reserve. They they come up with these inflation figures, you know. They try to forecast the inflation. They try to forecast the unemployment. This is macro work day in, day out.

405
00:54:00.600 --> 00:54:12.910
Vikesh K: This is. And again, this is used by finance firms as well. Right? Because if you figured out the unemployment rate, you can figure out 10 other things, you know, which stocks move. So this is a very useful. This is something which all the finance companies do a lot.

406
00:54:15.950 --> 00:54:20.049
Anu.Arun: And thank you. Thank you so much. Thank you. That took a long thank you all

407
00:54:20.180 --> 00:54:21.930
Anu.Arun: for patience. Yeah, thanks.

408
00:54:22.780 --> 00:54:24.810
Vikesh K: Anna, do you work in finance by by chance.

409
00:54:25.117 --> 00:54:26.960
Anu.Arun: No, no, I don't. I don't.

410
00:54:27.740 --> 00:54:29.300
Vikesh K: I thought, maybe you're working fine.

411
00:54:30.730 --> 00:54:32.223
Vikesh K: Cool. Okay.

412
00:54:33.320 --> 00:54:41.409
Vikesh K: Oh, there, I studied economic. This is what I wanted to do for a living. Then I realized, Oh, you can. This is not that interesting? So I moved to proper tech.

413
00:54:41.640 --> 00:54:44.080
Vikesh K: Yeah, this is initially what I have to do

414
00:54:44.440 --> 00:54:47.804
Vikesh K: alright. Any other questions or doubts. Thank you for that. Anu

415
00:54:50.383 --> 00:55:04.950
sai: So because because this is sai. So I have like I didn't get a chance to meet up for the capstone project, one on one, and previously it was there I was traveling a lot. So

416
00:55:05.080 --> 00:55:10.240
sai: is it possible to schedule now? Or is there any process we need to.

417
00:55:10.552 --> 00:55:13.340
Vikesh K: You're in. You're in Big City, you are, you know.

418
00:55:13.520 --> 00:55:15.669
sai: Section, A, with you.

419
00:55:15.670 --> 00:55:25.099
Vikesh K: So I I believe if I I still might have slots, I need to check that calendar link. But if if you, if there are still slots. You can book.

420
00:55:26.160 --> 00:55:27.469
sai: Okay. Okay. Sure.

421
00:55:27.470 --> 00:55:38.741
Vikesh K: Yeah, or or maybe I can also add some more slots if slots are over. But yeah, if you have, if there are slots available. You can just book. I would just request one thing. I I usually

422
00:55:39.540 --> 00:55:44.559
Vikesh K: have a template for folks to go through, so I will share it beforehand with you.

423
00:55:46.090 --> 00:55:51.450
Vikesh K: But yes, but then you can book the session with me, and I will add it. Okay.

424
00:55:51.760 --> 00:55:54.520
Vikesh K: So this helps me to streamline the whole thing.

425
00:55:55.950 --> 00:55:57.730
sai: Okay, sure. Yeah, thank you so much.

426
00:55:58.080 --> 00:56:08.429
Vikesh K: Yeah, you can prepare this thing the the template and you send it across. We can. We can talk about it, and we I will, I will check if I I still have the slot.

427
00:56:10.050 --> 00:56:11.890
sai: Okay, sure, yeah, thank you.

428
00:56:11.890 --> 00:56:12.220
Vikesh K: Yeah.

429
00:56:12.690 --> 00:56:15.720
Vikesh K: Cool others. Any question or doubt.

430
00:56:17.700 --> 00:56:19.749
shashi: Rikesh. I had one question.

431
00:56:21.100 --> 00:56:21.590
Vikesh K: Yes.

432
00:56:21.590 --> 00:56:26.451
shashi: I for my data analytics, capstone. I was,

433
00:56:27.910 --> 00:56:31.979
shashi: I have a record set of about roughly, about a million

434
00:56:31.980 --> 00:56:33.670
shashi: records, but the number of features.

435
00:56:33.670 --> 00:56:35.605
Vikesh K: Are around

436
00:56:36.600 --> 00:56:41.173
shashi: 100 50. So it when I, when I do the pivot and

437
00:56:41.970 --> 00:56:43.829
shashi: transfer them all to features.

438
00:56:44.510 --> 00:56:54.339
shashi: So it comes to around 25 to 30,000 rows of 20, approximately 20 to 25,000 rows of data. That should be sufficient, I think, right for building

439
00:56:55.086 --> 00:56:55.799
shashi: prediction model.

440
00:56:55.800 --> 00:57:00.040
Vikesh K: You basically roll it up at some group level, some at some level.

441
00:57:00.832 --> 00:57:04.097
shashi: No, no, it's the feature. I mean, the data is collected

442
00:57:04.900 --> 00:57:10.470
shashi: one feature at a time. So what happens is over the period of time they add up and

443
00:57:11.160 --> 00:57:17.799
shashi: for our feature. What do you call using the features for predicting? When we

444
00:57:17.940 --> 00:57:23.055
shashi: pivot it, it becomes the 100 1 million rows become

445
00:57:23.920 --> 00:57:27.262
shashi: let's say each feature has,

446
00:57:29.221 --> 00:57:35.159
shashi: roughly 1,000 data points. So when it pivots, it becomes around 20,000 rows of.

447
00:57:35.570 --> 00:57:39.580
shashi: So that is a sufficient amount of data. Right? That should be enough.

448
00:57:39.910 --> 00:57:42.410
Vikesh K: Yeah, so 20,000 rows. And how many columns.

449
00:57:43.060 --> 00:57:44.929
shashi: Roughly 100 20.

450
00:57:45.140 --> 00:57:49.199
Vikesh K: Okay? No, I think that's good. You have good amount of problem columns. There.

451
00:57:49.770 --> 00:57:50.200
shashi: Yeah.

452
00:57:50.200 --> 00:58:10.639
Vikesh K: That should be good. So again, this is a lot of it will also depend on your section leader. I try to sort of gently push the people in my section to pick up something complicated, because it's a good opportunity to learn and also showcase, you know, because May, if you pick up a simple. For example, many people pick up a simple stock price prediction

453
00:58:10.860 --> 00:58:22.238
Vikesh K: in my previous batch. Previous runs of this, when Tesla was growing very fast. They were like, Oh, we want to focus Tesla. But then you know, what they used to come up with is like a simple Tesla

454
00:58:22.680 --> 00:58:43.340
Vikesh K: open high volume trading. So basically 3 columns, you know the open, the close price of every day, the volume which was traded, and they wanted to do a capture over that. But that's not really useful, right? You. You have 2 columns all time series all numerical. You won't learn anything about categorical. There's no missing value, nothing complicated in life.

455
00:58:43.550 --> 00:58:47.549
Vikesh K: So I usually discourage doing those kind of projects.

456
00:58:48.640 --> 00:59:09.740
Vikesh K: because that's too simple. And also, you know, with with the stock market prediction. Everyone knows you haven't done a good job, because otherwise you would have been a billionaire a millionaire if you had cracked it. So it's very easy for at times for a stock price. Prediction problems. I can tell you your model is not good enough because you're not a millionaire or billionaire.

457
00:59:09.970 --> 00:59:24.519
Vikesh K: So I would say, pick up something which is more basic. I think you have. So she, your project sounds very realistic the kind of problems you will face, and I usually say the benchmark should be that practical application to the the car pricing.

458
00:59:24.920 --> 00:59:27.369
Vikesh K: So any pick up something which is

459
00:59:27.770 --> 00:59:37.200
Vikesh K: difficult at the same level, or more than that, not easier than that, because if the course has set a benchmark, the professors have set a benchmark, you don't really want to go below that.

460
00:59:37.970 --> 00:59:38.790
shashi: Got it? Yeah.

461
00:59:40.880 --> 00:59:42.560
