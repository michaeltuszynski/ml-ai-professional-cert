# Module 12: Classification and K-Nearest Neighbors Summary

## Video 1: Introduction to Classification

### Main Topic
- Introduction to classification as a machine learning problem
- Contrast between regression and classification

### Key Concepts
- **Classification Definition**: Given a set of features, predict the class to which a sample belongs
- **Contrast with Regression**:
  - Regression: Predict real-valued outcome
  - Classification: Predict discrete class membership

### Practical Example
- Email spam detection
  - Historical context of spam emails in early 2000s
  - Modern ML algorithms effectively detecting spam
- Loan payment prediction:
  - Features: Income, Total Debt
  - Classes: 'Paid' vs 'Did not pay'

### Technical Details
- Focus on binary classification (two classes)
- Tabular data emphasis rather than images/sound files
- Visual representation using scatter plots with color-coded classes

## Video 2: Nearest Neighbors in Scikit-Learn

### Main Topic
- Implementation of K-Nearest Neighbors classifier in scikit-learn

### Technical Implementation
```python
# Create classifier with k=1
from sklearn.neighbors import KNeighborsClassifier
model = KNeighborsClassifier(n_neighbors=1)

# Train model
model.fit(X, y)

# Make predictions
predictions = model.predict(new_data)
```

### Key Concepts
- Nearest neighbor classifier finds closest training point
- Decision boundaries visualization
- Model complexity vs k value relationship

### Common Pitfalls
- k=1 can lead to overfitting
- Complex decision boundaries suggest high variance
- Islands in decision space indicate potential overfitting

## Video 3: K-Nearest Neighbors

### Main Topic
- Improving nearest neighbor classification using multiple neighbors

### Key Concepts
- Using multiple neighbors (k>1)
- Majority voting for classification
- Complexity control through k parameter

### Technical Details
- k as hyperparameter
- Relationship between k and model complexity:
  - k=1: Maximum complexity
  - k=n: Minimum complexity (n = dataset size)
- Decision boundary smoothness increases with k

### Best Practices
- Balance between too few neighbors (overfitting) and too many (underfitting)
- Consider dataset size when choosing k
- Visualize decision boundaries for different k values

## Video 4: Choosing K

### Main Topic
- Methods for selecting optimal k value

### Technical Implementation
```python
from sklearn.model_selection import GridSearchCV

param_grid = {'n_neighbors': range(1, 226)}
grid_search = GridSearchCV(KNeighborsClassifier(), param_grid, cv=5)
grid_search.fit(X, y)
```

### Key Concepts
- Cross-validation for k selection
- Training vs validation error analysis
- Misclassification rate calculation

### Best Practices
- Use cross-validation to find optimal k
- Consider both training and validation error
- Monitor misclassification rate trends

## Video 5: Predict_proba and Decision Thresholds

### Main Topic
- Probability predictions and threshold selection

### Technical Details
```python
# Get probability predictions
probabilities = model.predict_proba(X)
```

### Key Concepts
- predict_proba() function returns class probabilities
- Default threshold of 0.5 for binary classification
- Adjustable threshold for classification decisions

### Best Practices
- Consider domain requirements when setting thresholds
- Understand probability interpretation for k-NN
- Account for ties in classification decisions

## Video 6: Classifier Metrics

### Main Topic
- Evaluation metrics for classification models

### Key Concepts
- Confusion Matrix Components:
  - True Negatives (TN)
  - False Positives (FP)
  - False Negatives (FN)
  - True Positives (TP)

### Important Metrics
1. Precision = TP/(TP + FP)
2. Recall = TP/(TP + FN)
3. Specificity = TN/(TN + FP)
4. Accuracy = (TP + TN)/(TP + TN + FP + FN)

### Best Practices
- Consider class imbalance when choosing metrics
- Use confusion matrix for detailed evaluation
- Don't rely solely on accuracy

## Video 7: Choosing a Classifier Metric

### Main Topic
- Trade-offs between different classification metrics

### Key Concepts
- Precision-Recall trade-off
- ROC curves
- Area Under Curve (AUC) metrics

### Technical Implementation
```python
from sklearn.metrics import precision_recall_curve
precision, recall, thresholds = precision_recall_curve(y_true, y_pred_proba)
```

### Best Practices
- Choose metrics based on domain requirements
- Consider business impact of false positives vs false negatives
- Use visual tools (PR curves, ROC curves) for model comparison

## Video 8: Regression Example: Using Nearest Neighbors for Regression

### Main Topic
- Applying k-NN to regression problems

### Technical Implementation
```python
from sklearn.neighbors import KNeighborsRegressor
regressor = KNeighborsRegressor(n_neighbors=k)
```

### Key Concepts
- k-NN adaptation for continuous outputs
- Averaging k nearest neighbors for prediction
- Smoothing effect of increasing k

### Common Pitfalls
- Less common in practice for regression
- Can be computationally expensive
- Sensitive to local variations

## Video 9: Refugee Resettlement and Prediction

### Main Topic
- Real-world application of classification in refugee resettlement

### Key Concepts
- Matching effects in prediction
- Random assignment importance
- Impact evaluation

### Case Study Results
- 41% employment increase potential in US
- 73% employment increase potential in Switzerland
- Cost-effective compared to traditional interventions

### Best Practices
- Consider theory of change
- Look for randomization opportunities
- Focus on matching effects
