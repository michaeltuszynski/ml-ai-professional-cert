# Machine Learning Classification Quiz

## Question 1 (1 point)
What is the goal of classification in machine learning?

**Options:**
1. To generalize and predict labels for unseen data
2. To predict a real-valued outcome given a set of features
3. To identify the nearest neighbor from the training data
4. To perform regression analysis on categorical data

**Answer:** Option 1: To generalize and predict labels for unseen data

*Explanation:* Classification's primary goal is to learn patterns from labeled training data to predict discrete class labels for new, unseen instances. This differs from regression (continuous outputs) and is more general than just finding nearest neighbors.

## Question 2 (1 point)
Given an individual's income of $8,000 and debt of $600, what is the most likely status of their payment?

**Options:**
1. Paid
2. Did not pay
3. Status unknown
4. No debt

**Answer:** Option 1: Paid

*Explanation:* Based on the visualization shown, the data point ($8,000 income, $600 debt) falls in the region where most points are marked as "Paid" (Note: This assumes the visualization shows a clear decision boundary).

## Question 3 (1 point)
Which of the following is not a classification model?

**Options:**
1. Linear regression
2. Nearest neighbors
3. Decision trees
4. Random forests

**Answer:** Option 1: Linear regression

*Explanation:* Linear regression is a regression model that predicts continuous numerical values, while the other options (nearest neighbors, decision trees, and random forests) can be used for classification tasks.

# Answer Key
1. Option 1 - To generalize and predict labels for unseen data (Core definition of classification)
2. Option 1 - Paid (Based on visualization of income/debt relationship)
3. Option 1 - Linear regression (Regression model vs classification models)
