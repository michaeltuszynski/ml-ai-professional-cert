# Mini-Lesson 12.1: Classification vs. Regression

## Overview
Classification and regression are fundamental types of supervised learning algorithms used in machine learning for predictive modeling based on input data. As you read on the previous page, classification involves predicting categorical labels, aiming to assign inputs to predefined classes or categories. For instance, an email spam detector categorizes emails as either "spam" or "not spam." Regression, on the other hand, predicts continuous numerical values, for example, predicting the price of a house based on features such as size, location, and number of rooms.

## Evaluation Metrics
Since classification outputs categorical values and regression outputs continuous values, their evaluation metrics differ accordingly. For regression models, evaluation metrics such as **mean squared error (MSE)** and **mean absolute error** are commonly used. In contrast, classification models are evaluated using metrics such as:
- Accuracy
- Precision
- Recall
- F1 score
- Receiver Operating Characteristics Area Under the Curve (ROC AUC)

This distinction ensures the appropriate assessment and optimization of models tailored to their specific output types and applications in machine learning.
