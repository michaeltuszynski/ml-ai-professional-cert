Mini-Lesson 23.3: Transformer-Based Models

Transformer-based models have revolutionized NLP by offering a more efficient and scalable approach to handling and generating text. Here is a brief overview of how these models work:
Tokenization and Embeddings

    Tokenization: The first step in processing text involves breaking down sentences into manageable units called tokens. Tokens can be words, subwords, or characters. Modern transformers often use subword tokenization (e.g., Byte-Pair Encoding or WordPiece) to handle unknown words and improve efficiency.
    Embeddings: Each token is represented as a vector in a high-dimensional space. This vector captures semantic information about the token. They provide dense representations of tokens, capturing semantic relationships. One additional note is that embeddings are often pre-trained and fine-tuned for specific tasks. For example, the word “king” might be represented by a vector of 300 dimensions, capturing its meaning concerning other words.

The Transformer Architecture

    Embedding Phase: The text is converted into an embedded matrix, in which each token is represented by its embedding vector. This phase creates the initial token representations.
    Self-Attention Mechanism: This phase allows the model to weigh the importance of each token in the context of the other tokens. For example, in the sentence “He devoured the orange,” the model needs to determine whether “orange” refers to the fruit or the color. The self-attention mechanism helps the model understand these contextual nuances by adjusting token representations based on their relationships. It computes a weighted average of all tokens in the sequence, which enables the model to capture long-range dependencies.
    Multi-Head Attention: The model uses multiple attention heads to capture different aspects of token relationships simultaneously, enriching the token representations. Each attention head learns to represent different aspects of the input, enriching the overall understanding.
    Feed-Forward Networks: After attention, each token representation is processed through a feed-forward neural network, allowing the model to learn complex patterns and relationships.

Generating Text

    Unembedding Phase: Once the text is transformed into a richer representation, the model generates the final output. This involves mapping the enriched token representations back to the vocabulary space using a final matrix multiplication, producing a probability distribution for each possible next token.

Training

    Transformers are trained on large text corpora using supervised learning when the model predicts the next token in a sequence. Training involves optimizing billions of parameters to approximate the probability distribution of text on the Internet. This process often involves pre-training on a general corpus followed by fine-tuning task-specific data that can provide additional context.

Key Takeaways

    Efficiency: Transformers handle long-range dependencies in text better than previous models.
    Scalability: They can be scaled up to handle very large datasets and complex tasks.
    Versatility: Transformers are the foundation of many advanced NLP applications, including text generation, translation, and summarization.

Transformers have set new benchmarks in NLP, enabling models such as GPT-3 and BERT to achieve state-of-the-art results across various tasks. Understanding these components helps in appreciating the sophistication and power of modern language models.
