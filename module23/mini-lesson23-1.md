# Mini-Lesson 23.1: The History of Generative AI

Generative AI (Gen AI) focuses on creating new data and mimicking human creativity. Its origins trace back to early developments in machine learning when researchers explored models capable of generating content such as text and images. Below is a timeline of key milestones in the development of Gen AI.

## Early Foundations

In the 1990s, probabilistic models such as hidden Markov models (HMMs) and Gaussian mixture models (GMMs) laid the groundwork for data generation, particularly in the fields of speech and image processing.

## The Emergence of RNNs

Recurrent neural networks (RNNs), introduced in the 1980s, marked a significant milestone, especially with the advent of long short-term memory (LSTM) networks in the early 2000s. RNNs excelled at generating coherent sequences of text and handling other types of sequential data.

## GANs Revolutionize Gen AI

Generative adversarial networks (GANs), introduced by Ian Goodfellow in 2014, revolutionized the field by enabling the generation of realistic images through an adversarial process involving a generator and a discriminator.
