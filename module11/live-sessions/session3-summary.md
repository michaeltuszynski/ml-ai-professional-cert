# Module 11 - Live Session 3 Summary

## Key Discussion Points

### Using AI Tools in Coursework
1. Discussion on appropriate use of ChatGPT and AI tools:
   - Acceptable to use for syntax help and code implementation
   - Focus should be on understanding the logic and approach yourself
   - AI tools can help with coding efficiency, similar to using Stack Overflow
   - Recommended to reduce AI dependency as you progress towards the capstone project

### Project Discussion
1. Current Project Overview:
   - Dataset: 3 million used car prices from Kaggle
   - Objective: Determine factors affecting car prices and ideal pricing strategy
   - Shared Jupyter notebook with structured sections:
     - Data Quality
     - EDA (Exploratory Data Analysis)
     - Preprocessing
     - Feature Selection
     - Modeling

2. Methodology Discussion:
   - Breaking down the problem into manageable components
   - Collaborative approach to gather inputs from all participants
   - Focus on understanding the process before implementation
   - Discussion of regression techniques:
     - Linear regression
     - Ridge regression
     - Polynomial regression (noted as less suitable due to categorical variables)

### Best Practices
1. Focus on:
   - Understanding the overall process
   - Writing well-structured code
   - Applying learning to practical work scenarios
   - Building foundational knowledge in AI/ML space

2. Course Expectations:
   - Emphasis on understanding concepts over code originality
