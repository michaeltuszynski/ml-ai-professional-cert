# Module 11 - Live Session 1 Summary

## Session Overview
- Informal mentorship session focused on industry guidance and practical advice
- Led by Vikesh K., with multiple student participants

## Key Topics Discussed

### A/B Testing
- Explained as a method to test different versions of products/features
- Example: Testing different website layouts with 50/50 user split
- Important for product decisions, especially in customer-facing websites
- Requires sufficient sample size for statistical significance
- Used for testing ML models (e.g., comparing recommendation systems)

### Industry Roles & Career Guidance

#### Machine Learning Engineer Role
- Requires combination of coding and math/statistics knowledge
- More specialized than general software engineering
- Common in teams like ranking, recommendations, and fraud detection
- Interview process includes:
  - Coding rounds (e.g., HackerRank)
  - Business case discussions
  - System design specific to ML
  - ML knowledge assessment

#### Data Science Market Conditions
- Currently described as "brutal" with high competition
- Companies have many applications to choose from
- Domain knowledge becoming increasingly important
- Advice for transitions: Move within same industry first

### Practical ML Implementation Tips

#### Data Cleaning & Preprocessing
- Start with basic model using clean columns
- Create baseline metrics before optimization
- Handle missing data carefully
- Consider correlation between features
- Be mindful of one-hot encoding with high cardinality
- Use appropriate encoding techniques for different data types

#### Model Development Strategy
- Start with simple baseline models
- Document improvements and iterations
- Balance accuracy improvements with business needs
- Consider the cost-benefit of model improvements
- Focus on practical business impact over perfect accuracy
