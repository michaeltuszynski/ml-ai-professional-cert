1
00:01:44.390 --> 00:01:50.910
Jessica: Alright! Hello, everybody! And welcome to the module. 11 office hour

2
00:01:50.950 --> 00:01:55.519
Jessica: for the professional certificate in machine learning. And AI

3
00:01:56.044 --> 00:02:11.380
Jessica: so 1st of all apologies for rescheduling. Yesterday I was traveling, and the office hour was conflicting with my flight. But I am happy that we're here today, so as you probably imagine

4
00:02:11.410 --> 00:02:21.580
Jessica: the office hour today is going to be very brief, because module 11 is another one of the practical application modules. So

5
00:02:21.690 --> 00:02:27.758
Jessica: there isn't really much new content. But there is the

6
00:02:28.660 --> 00:02:54.440
Jessica: the second practical application assignment that you will have to complete to complete the module. So I do have, you know, 2 slides that are very, very short. So I am actually gonna share this with you today. But really, I want to switch right away and go on canvas

7
00:02:54.540 --> 00:03:06.530
Jessica: to talk about the practical application assignment and the expectations. Hello, everybody. Thank you for joining. Yeah. So let me share my screen here.

8
00:03:07.150 --> 00:03:22.680
Jessica: And again, this is gonna be a probably 20 min office hour, maybe even less. But yeah, I just wanted to. Talk about the expectations for the this practical application assignment. So

9
00:03:22.710 --> 00:03:29.050
Jessica: you went through the 1st practical application in Module 5.

10
00:03:29.120 --> 00:03:40.320
Jessica: This is a similar format. It's a different assignment. It's a different data set. You're gonna have to use different techniques for this assignment. But essentially.

11
00:03:40.360 --> 00:03:45.210
Jessica: you are what you are. You are giving a

12
00:03:45.680 --> 00:04:00.959
Jessica: data set with over 400,000 rows. That contains information about vehicles. And you want to try and predict the price of a vehicle based on the data set that's given.

13
00:04:01.120 --> 00:04:02.180
Jessica: So

14
00:04:02.812 --> 00:04:15.500
Jessica: this is going to be a regression type of problem. Okay? So you're given some information about the vehicles. And you are. Your goal is to predict the price.

15
00:04:15.730 --> 00:04:20.371
Jessica: Okay, the data set

16
00:04:21.930 --> 00:04:28.920
Jessica: I am gonna download it now, it's quite large. So it's gonna take a second to open.

17
00:04:42.508 --> 00:04:44.400
vbudhiraja: I have a question, Jessica.

18
00:04:44.620 --> 00:04:45.290
Jessica: Yes.

19
00:04:45.620 --> 00:05:00.460
vbudhiraja: So my! The way I was reading it was saying that what affects the value of the car as compared to predict the price, like, what features gonna be more important that gonna influence of the car.

20
00:05:01.110 --> 00:05:23.800
Jessica: Yeah, so well, like an approach to do that would be to you know, like, run a model with some of the variables inside this data set and try and see which ones give you the more accurate price prediction. So you have the price here.

21
00:05:23.930 --> 00:05:42.799
Jessica: and you have this these other variables that you can use as input okay, there are some missing values. Okay, it's part of the homework is to clean this data set. But, like you can. For example, in order to determine which ones are more important, an approach would be to.

22
00:05:42.890 --> 00:06:05.059
Jessica: you know, like, try different regression models. Okay? So like linear regression, lasso regression and ridge regression. And see if you can figure out using those machine learning methods which ones which variables are more important and can give you the more accurate price which you have.

23
00:06:07.010 --> 00:06:09.870
Jessica: because otherwise, like, how are you gonna just

24
00:06:10.200 --> 00:06:20.139
Jessica: like, based on like, what are you gonna use to predict the the price of the house. You have to use the tools that you've learned in the course, in order

25
00:06:20.340 --> 00:06:41.710
Jessica: to to understand which variables are more important, and you can do that by using linear regression to predict the price of a car. And then the variables that give you the most accurate result based on the real values that you have here is going to help you determine which variables are more important.

26
00:06:42.410 --> 00:06:43.739
vbudhiraja: Makes sense. Thank you.

27
00:06:44.010 --> 00:06:54.520
Jessica: So, yeah, so obviously, this data set is quite large. There are missing values. Okay, so careful with that, spend time cleaning your data. Set

28
00:06:54.970 --> 00:07:02.810
Jessica: again, whether you want to drop rows or columns, or you want to try and impute the missing values. That's all. Up to you.

29
00:07:02.820 --> 00:07:12.709
Jessica: the practical application don't have a unique solution. So if you know, do whatever you think, it's right to clean this data

30
00:07:12.810 --> 00:07:14.762
Jessica: and then try and

31
00:07:15.750 --> 00:07:21.270
Jessica: understand which variables are more important when predicting the price of a car. Now.

32
00:07:21.970 --> 00:07:29.880
Jessica: you know, when we were we when we were talking about data, cleaning and variables, and you know which ones to pick.

33
00:07:30.090 --> 00:07:53.300
Jessica: you know. Use a little bit of common sense. The win of a car is not going to impact the price. Okay, so there are some obvious variables here that are not useful for prediction that really don't impact the price of a car based on common sense. So you know, you can definitely restrict the subset of input variable

34
00:07:53.470 --> 00:08:08.070
Jessica: for your prediction. But among the ones that are important, so like the ear, the manufacturer, the model, the condition, the cylinders fuel, the odometer, perhaps. You know which ones are more important.

35
00:08:08.230 --> 00:08:12.360
Jessica: That is up to you to determine with this exercise.

36
00:08:13.130 --> 00:08:17.870
Jessica: So essentially, take what you've learned so far in the course.

37
00:08:18.300 --> 00:08:22.479
Jessica: Okay, from module one to module 10 and

38
00:08:22.490 --> 00:08:34.073
Jessica: implement and apply it to the practical application assignment to see if you can find a good solution. Now, part of the

39
00:08:35.770 --> 00:08:41.060
Jessica: challenge when it comes to this type of assignment is also

40
00:08:41.159 --> 00:08:51.520
Jessica: deciding which techniques to use. So I give you a hint. This is a regression problem. Okay, so you're going to have to use like the regression algorithms that we've learned

41
00:08:51.780 --> 00:09:01.160
Jessica: like this is not a classification problem. So some of the things that you've learned in the previous modules you won't be using. But, you know, go back and

42
00:09:01.320 --> 00:09:08.509
Jessica: see if you can find any other technique or algorithms that can help you with this assignment.

43
00:09:10.373 --> 00:09:12.060
Jessica: Regarding the

44
00:09:14.830 --> 00:09:26.749
Jessica: the the format for submission is the same as Module 5. So you have to upload your practical application to a Github Repository.

45
00:09:26.840 --> 00:09:39.419
Jessica: Make sure that all necessary files are there. Write to the readme file and submit the link to your public Github Repository for grading so nothing new there.

46
00:09:39.710 --> 00:09:48.500
Jessica: And the of course, I want to spend a little bit of time. Oh, this should be a readme file again.

47
00:09:52.840 --> 00:09:54.130
Jessica: yeah.

48
00:09:56.130 --> 00:09:57.470
Jessica: this

49
00:09:58.250 --> 00:10:12.529
Jessica: ignoring this part of the rubric, this should be a read me the same as module. 5. Okay, this is an error in design. I'm gonna communicate that after this office hour but

50
00:10:12.530 --> 00:10:30.439
Jessica: before submitting the assignment, please, please, please look at the rubric. Okay, it's the only thing that we use to grade the assignment beside looking at your code and see if it makes sense. But if you hit all the points, all the like sections in the rubric.

51
00:10:30.470 --> 00:10:36.430
Jessica: and your assignment makes sense, and your solution makes sense, you're likely going to get a very, very high grade.

52
00:10:36.610 --> 00:10:50.549
Jessica: the points start being taken away when you don't look at the rubric, and your submission doesn't match the rubric. Okay, if I don't want to be mean. But if you don't have a

53
00:10:50.850 --> 00:11:05.079
Jessica: you know, like the data set, or you don't have the the link to the notebook in your readme file. I know it's, you know, a small thing. But I I we are basing our

54
00:11:05.460 --> 00:11:21.250
Jessica: basing, our grading on the rubric. Okay. So before submitting, I really hate taking away 2 points because you forgot to insert the link in the readme file, it's a small thing. Okay, you can have the perfect analysis.

55
00:11:21.604 --> 00:11:26.440
Jessica: And I really really dislike doing that. But I have to do it if it's not there.

56
00:11:27.110 --> 00:11:28.190
Jessica: So

57
00:11:28.860 --> 00:11:53.209
Jessica: make sure that you know, like you check the rubric. The rubric is very similar to the module 5. There is a new section, though, so we have the project organization, the syntax and code quality, the visualizations. The new part is the modeling. Okay? So for the module 5 assignment, you didn't have a modeling part because you didn't know any algorithms. There.

58
00:11:53.290 --> 00:12:08.979
Jessica: now you do. So you have to use multiple regression model and cross validation grid search the hyper parameters, interpret the coefficient look at the error. You know all the things that we've learned about how to use

59
00:12:09.543 --> 00:12:13.280
Jessica: the regression algorithms that we've seen in the course. Okay?

60
00:12:13.540 --> 00:12:32.730
Jessica: And then, of course, the findings where the findings are. We don't care. Some of you put them in the readme. Some of you put them in the notebook. That doesn't matter as long as there is a clear section that states in, not in technical terms, what the results are. We don't care where you put that.

61
00:12:33.526 --> 00:12:35.040
Jessica: That information!

62
00:12:35.813 --> 00:12:38.529
Jessica: But it's important that you

63
00:12:39.510 --> 00:12:40.480
Jessica: excuse me

64
00:12:42.620 --> 00:13:09.779
Jessica: that you write your findings out, because it's very important to practice being able to communicate the results with the client. Right? If you're given a problem as a data scientist, it's most likely because somebody doesn't know how to solve it. So after solving the problem. It's important that you are able to communicate to people that don't know data. Science don't know algorithms in, you know.

65
00:13:09.780 --> 00:13:17.210
Jessica: normal terms. Okay, non-scientifical terms what your results are and what your recommendations are, which is why

66
00:13:17.310 --> 00:13:18.740
Jessica: their findings is

67
00:13:18.970 --> 00:13:22.459
Jessica: often overlooked. But it is very, very important.

68
00:13:22.610 --> 00:13:23.460
Jessica: Okay.

69
00:13:24.010 --> 00:13:27.050
Jessica: do you guys have any questions on this.

70
00:13:35.980 --> 00:13:36.650
Ravi Duvvuri: No.

71
00:13:36.840 --> 00:13:44.519
Jessica: Okay. Great. Sorry. Okay. So that is everything for the practical application assignment.

72
00:13:44.740 --> 00:14:05.899
Jessica: The other thing that I want to flag is that in the next few weeks, or maybe you already received an announcement about this. You are invited to book your one on one consultation about the capstone project. Okay? So now that you guys are starting to having a

73
00:14:05.900 --> 00:14:19.359
Jessica: collection or a portfolio of techniques and algorithms available that you're learning. And hopefully, you're getting a good idea of what solving a machine learning problem means.

74
00:14:19.380 --> 00:14:26.270
Jessica: It's time to start thinking a little bit more seriously about your capstone project.

75
00:14:26.440 --> 00:14:32.010
Jessica: So in the over you should have received a link. Let me see if I can find it.

76
00:14:37.310 --> 00:14:38.670
Jessica: Oh.

77
00:14:44.830 --> 00:14:50.040
Kiran: Can we? Can we change the problem statement for Capstone project now or.

78
00:14:50.040 --> 00:14:50.599
Jessica: You can.

79
00:14:50.600 --> 00:14:51.330
Kiran: Okay.

80
00:14:51.330 --> 00:14:55.820
Jessica: Yeah, so you should have received this announcement.

81
00:14:56.160 --> 00:15:19.430
Jessica: So you are invited to book your 1st one-on-one consultation with the learning facilitator of your section. Okay, it's very important that if you are in Section A, you book with Vikash, if you're in Section B, you book with me and so on. This is to keep things straight and to keep our load work balanced among the 5 of us.

82
00:15:19.879 --> 00:15:27.250
Jessica: So you we we are inviting you to click on the link of your learning facilitator

83
00:15:27.440 --> 00:15:29.840
Jessica: book, a time that works for you.

84
00:15:29.990 --> 00:15:50.949
Jessica: And essentially, during this 30 min consultation, you're going to meet with your learning facilitator. We do recommend that you have an idea of what you want to do, for the Capstone project doesn't have to be final. But don't come absolutely unprepared.

85
00:15:51.307 --> 00:16:17.050
Jessica: I'm prepared, if you, if you, we cannot tell you what topic to pick for the capstone project, we're not gonna do that. So if you come to us and say, I don't know what to do for the Capstone project, we're gonna tell you. Okay, go think about it. And book another call next week. Because it's your capstone project. And you want, you have to pick the topic. Okay.

86
00:16:17.090 --> 00:16:25.189
Jessica: we can help you choose a data set. We can help you with the techniques. We can guide you through it. But we're not going to pick one for you.

87
00:16:25.360 --> 00:16:31.709
Jessica: So once you have an idea of what you want to do or what you would like to do.

88
00:16:32.260 --> 00:17:00.839
Jessica: Book your consultations. You can book these from now until the end of module 13. So you have 2 weeks to do that. You have lots of time slots. And during this 30 min consultation it's very informal. Okay, nothing to be scared about. And we're just going to talk about your ideas, and we're going to give you suggestions. See if we think that your project is good, or maybe we recommend a different approach. So it's really like your chance to talk

89
00:17:01.080 --> 00:17:05.580
Jessica: one on one with your learning facilitator and really like

90
00:17:06.569 --> 00:17:19.450
Jessica: start start working on the Capstone project. Okay, we are gonna recommend to work on the Capstone project a bit at a time. Okay, we don't want you to leave it until the end of the course.

91
00:17:20.136 --> 00:17:21.490
Jessica: So yeah.

92
00:17:21.630 --> 00:17:26.802
Jessica: go on. You know, for example, these are, this is my calendar. Okay?

93
00:17:27.780 --> 00:17:28.970
Jessica: you know, there is.

94
00:17:29.190 --> 00:17:39.840
Jessica: You can click on the dates. You can pick the time. And I also have some dates all throughout December. And actually some of January, too.

95
00:17:40.960 --> 00:17:48.099
Jessica: I think I need to correct this because I don't want to work on Christmas Day. But you know, like

96
00:17:48.390 --> 00:18:05.959
Jessica: pick a day and a time that works for you, and if no time works okay, if you don't see any time that works for you, open a ticket with your learning facilitator, explain the situation. And we can, you know, find another time, I'm sure. Okay.

97
00:18:06.170 --> 00:18:20.940
Jessica: But it's these one-on-ones are very, very important. Okay, they can really talking one on one for 30 min with your learning facilitator about the capstone project can give you a lot of insight about it, and you are going to feel

98
00:18:20.940 --> 00:18:39.310
Jessica: a lot more relaxed after that, because some of you are probably feeling a little bit anxious about the capstone, and I don't blame you. So now it's the time to, you know, get in contact and get to know each other better as well, and then have a conversation about this this capsule. Okay?

99
00:18:40.450 --> 00:18:43.869
Jessica: Any questions concerns.

100
00:18:49.090 --> 00:18:57.859
Jessica: That is all I had for today, because this was a module 11 office hour. By the way, I think I did an office hour

101
00:18:57.920 --> 00:19:22.289
Jessica: on linear regression where I used a car data set to predict the price of a car. So the data set, it's not the same as the practical application assignment. The problem is a little bit different. Okay, but if you want a refresh before you start the capstone, the practical application assignment, you can go back and watch that office hour and look at the code. And

102
00:19:22.616 --> 00:19:29.200
Jessica: you know. Take a little bit of inspiration. It's obviously not the same one. Yes, I think it was the week 7.

103
00:19:29.250 --> 00:19:46.030
Jessica: It's my office hour about linear regression. So it's obviously a different data set. But you know, if you just want to see, like some of the steps and the approach you can. You can go there and take, you know. Take a look before you get your hands dirty with the practical application assignment.

104
00:19:50.500 --> 00:19:51.659
Jessica: Okay?

105
00:19:53.190 --> 00:19:54.140
vbudhiraja: Question.

106
00:19:54.360 --> 00:19:55.040
Jessica: Yeah.

107
00:19:55.350 --> 00:20:19.010
vbudhiraja: So like, we are doing this project here for car data prediction. How the how big of effort capstone project gonna be as compared to this one. And how much we need to do in the capstone project. Obviously, here we are getting one week to do it. There we're gonna have a month and a half or 2 months to do that. What's the difference?

108
00:20:19.010 --> 00:20:20.620
Jessica: Well.

109
00:20:21.240 --> 00:20:43.360
Jessica: so time wise we project. So for a practical application assignment, we aim at 15 h on average, each of you should dedicate 15 h to the practical application assignment. Some of you take more, some of you take less for the Capstone project. We do project, I think, 25 h.

110
00:20:43.460 --> 00:20:47.734
Jessica: Okay, so it's a little bit more complex. But

111
00:20:49.100 --> 00:20:58.140
Jessica: you have to consider that for the Capstone project you have to find a data set and often finding a data set. It's not just a simple Google search.

112
00:20:58.190 --> 00:21:09.060
Jessica: Often your data is gonna come very like not clean. And you're gonna have to spend a lot of time cleaning the data so like when it comes to the capstone project

113
00:21:09.090 --> 00:21:13.299
Jessica: it, it's definitely a little bit more intense

114
00:21:13.320 --> 00:21:17.567
Jessica: than the practical application assignment. It has more components.

115
00:21:18.300 --> 00:21:19.490
Jessica: but it's

116
00:21:19.660 --> 00:21:29.259
Jessica: very similar. It's just a it's just like a more complex version of a practical application assignment with a topic

117
00:21:29.290 --> 00:21:30.920
Jessica: that you pick yourself.

118
00:21:31.342 --> 00:21:38.849
Jessica: So yeah, like 25 to 30 h for the capstone project. It's what we expect for you to spend on it on average.

119
00:21:39.934 --> 00:21:49.935
Jessica: It really depends, though, like some of you spend 50 HI had. I had a learner, one spending 6 months on it, you know which was extremely

120
00:21:50.810 --> 00:22:05.439
Jessica: you know, it was a little bit too much. Let's just say that. But some of you spend less time, and at the end of the day, like, we just want you to pick a topic that you like and apply the concept that you've learned in the course.

121
00:22:05.550 --> 00:22:28.899
Jessica: Okay, and we want you to being able to select the techniques and algorithms that you've learned from the course that work best for your capstone project. Okay, some of you are gonna pick a regression problem. Some of you are going to pick a classification problem. Some of you are gonna pick a natural language processing problem.

122
00:22:28.990 --> 00:22:40.219
Jessica: Okay? So depending on the type of project that you want to solve the techniques and algorithms that each one use is going to be different, and that is part of the capstone.

123
00:22:42.450 --> 00:22:43.690
Jessica: Does that help.

124
00:22:43.980 --> 00:22:45.560
vbudhiraja: Yep, thank you.

125
00:22:45.670 --> 00:22:56.559
vbudhiraja: So we can focus on the capstone project to be more learning focus as compared to trying to do something specific. Because then you are limited by the

126
00:22:56.580 --> 00:23:08.760
vbudhiraja: your thought process what you're trying to achieve but achieve. But if you go with the learning model, you can have a broader project, and you try to accommodate as much as you can what you learn.

127
00:23:09.250 --> 00:23:12.659
Jessica: Yeah, well, you have to be careful with that, because.

128
00:23:12.900 --> 00:23:22.599
Jessica: you know, like, it's really easy to get lost that way. So the way I would go about. This is that I would try and think about something that you guys are interested in

129
00:23:22.690 --> 00:23:28.669
Jessica: hobby work, anything. I had projects on spotify playlists

130
00:23:29.284 --> 00:23:43.830
Jessica: crypto or straight up work. I've seen it all okay, and or, you know, predict who's gonna win the Fifa World Cup, and the next 2026, or whenever it is so, pick a topic that you like, and then

131
00:23:44.160 --> 00:23:56.170
Jessica: ask yourself, Okay, what would I like to know? What? What am I interesting in predicting about this topic. And then you can find a data set that hopefully accommodates that and has the correct information.

132
00:23:56.680 --> 00:23:58.879
Jessica: And then you can

133
00:23:59.820 --> 00:24:15.910
Jessica: and then you can apply the correct techniques to solve that problem. Don't try and jam as many algorithms as you can in the capstone project because some of them are just not going to work. You cannot apply logistic regression and linear or

134
00:24:16.340 --> 00:24:20.550
Jessica: linear regression to the same problem. Those are 2 separate techniques

135
00:24:21.045 --> 00:24:24.689
Jessica: that are used to predict different things. Right? So

136
00:24:25.321 --> 00:24:51.719
Jessica: it's have a clear idea of what you want to predict. And then, as you progress through the course, and as you learn more work on your capstone project, and try and incorporate ideally module by module what you learned. So if you work ideally, you would work on the Capstone project a little bit each week, and as you learn more, you incorporate more and more in the capstone project.

137
00:24:53.530 --> 00:24:54.030
vbudhiraja: Thank you.

138
00:24:54.530 --> 00:24:55.120
Jessica: Yeah.

139
00:24:57.180 --> 00:25:05.350
Ravi Duvvuri: And Jessica. Sorry I missed it. When do we need to schedule appointments with the facilitators one on ones.

140
00:25:06.065 --> 00:25:10.430
Jessica: Yeah, you can go on this announcement page.

141
00:25:10.840 --> 00:25:12.439
Jessica: I put it in the chat

142
00:25:12.480 --> 00:25:20.560
Jessica: and based on the section you're in, you can just click on this calendar links and you will be able to book with us.

143
00:25:22.150 --> 00:25:25.110
Ravi Duvvuri: Okay, and how soon we have to do it.

144
00:25:26.322 --> 00:25:28.879
Jessica: The consultation open.

145
00:25:34.540 --> 00:25:38.079
Jessica: Between modules 12 and 15. So

146
00:25:38.730 --> 00:25:42.119
Jessica: once Module 12 gets released

147
00:25:42.517 --> 00:25:58.292
Jessica: and you will see in the calendar the the dates that are available right you. The 1st day is the 1st day of Module 12, and the last day is the last day of module 15 I need to fix my calendar because I don't wanna work during the Christmas break

148
00:25:58.650 --> 00:26:17.049
Jessica: But and I'm sure you don't want either. But essentially week 1213, 14, and 15. So you have 4 modules to to book a time, and it doesn't matter when you do it. You know if you're ready. Just book it early, and if you need a little bit extra time, do it

149
00:26:17.240 --> 00:26:19.330
Jessica: a little bit later. It's fine.

150
00:26:20.460 --> 00:26:30.989
Ravi Duvvuri: Okay? So we already submitted the project, right? Like what we want to work on it. So we are going to review the same? Or do we need to work on it anything before we schedule it?

151
00:26:31.450 --> 00:26:32.370
Jessica: I mean.

152
00:26:32.570 --> 00:26:55.240
Jessica: if you want to use that as your capstone project. We can, we can totally discuss that. But if you this was in Module 6. So now we are in Module 11, and you know a lot more now. So if you want to change your mind, we can also discuss that. And that's totally possible. Yeah, no worries.

153
00:27:01.430 --> 00:27:14.839
Jessica: Alright, okay. So I think that's all for today. I'll give you guys a little bit of your time back, I think next week it's a break week, so I won't see you for

154
00:27:15.180 --> 00:27:32.160
Jessica: a couple of weeks. I think so. Good luck with your practical application assignment book the one on one consultation. Okay, you want to do it today. You can book it today and then even move it. Okay, you can reschedule it if that day doesn't end up working for you. But don't forget. Okay.

155
00:27:32.200 --> 00:27:40.299
Jessica: And yeah, good luck with module 11. And I will see you in a couple of weeks bye, and have a good rest of your day and a good weekend.
