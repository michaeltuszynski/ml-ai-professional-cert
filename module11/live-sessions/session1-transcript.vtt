1
00:00:02.100 --> 00:00:03.100
Vikesh K: Okay, welcome.

2
00:00:03.650 --> 00:00:13.179
Vikesh K: I'm not sure how many more people will join. There are a couple of people joining just a reminder. This is more of a, you know, informal mentorship session, which we have

3
00:00:13.670 --> 00:00:26.480
Vikesh K: rather than you know, an office hour session. So, the idea being, we will keep it. I try to keep it more open, ended. There are some. There's a deck, as you can see. This is on industry guidance, but I would rather maybe

4
00:00:26.510 --> 00:00:31.929
Vikesh K: I believe many of you, many of the things that we cover in this deck you would already know, because all of you have been

5
00:00:32.299 --> 00:00:37.360
Vikesh K: working or have some work experience, right? But I can talk specifically

6
00:00:37.480 --> 00:00:39.769
Vikesh K: on something around data science.

7
00:00:40.240 --> 00:00:42.309
Vikesh K: which is which is covered here.

8
00:00:42.820 --> 00:00:43.440
Vikesh K: And

9
00:00:44.360 --> 00:00:48.660
Vikesh K: mainly, I'm not sure how many of you are interested in switching

10
00:00:49.046 --> 00:00:52.250
Vikesh K: in case you're not. So maybe this won't be

11
00:00:52.440 --> 00:00:55.250
Vikesh K: super relevant. But we can still talk about it.

12
00:00:55.590 --> 00:00:58.249
Vikesh K: There are a couple of more people in the

13
00:00:59.340 --> 00:01:03.259
Vikesh K: in the waiting room. Okay, now we have all of

14
00:01:03.860 --> 00:01:06.230
Vikesh K: of all the folks. Okay.

15
00:01:06.870 --> 00:01:12.302
Vikesh K: we avinash Deepak Karen. Okay, I think for Preeti. It might be useful.

16
00:01:12.950 --> 00:01:14.689
Vikesh K: Oh, there's 1 more person joining.

17
00:01:16.620 --> 00:01:29.040
Vikesh K: Okay. So folks who just joined this is more of an informal session. We would just talk about sort of the data science and industry and might be more useful for those of you looking for a job in the

18
00:01:29.816 --> 00:01:32.850
Vikesh K: field. Okay, this is

19
00:01:33.700 --> 00:01:44.549
Vikesh K: all like couple of other stuff. But I would want to focus maybe more on the data science stuff. Right? Some of the thing which which keeps floating around.

20
00:01:44.740 --> 00:01:50.269
Vikesh K: And you know the material which is prepared here, as you can see, there's some myth

21
00:01:50.850 --> 00:01:56.659
Vikesh K: and some gold States, right? You know what exactly happens in the industry.

22
00:01:56.770 --> 00:02:04.709
Vikesh K: but what I would say from my personal experience, and also what I've seen in my colleagues and seniors and juniors is.

23
00:02:04.980 --> 00:02:09.220
Vikesh K: yeah, the it's a very hyped up field. That's that's for sure.

24
00:02:09.300 --> 00:02:16.190
Vikesh K: I sometimes now think there's also a good amount of supply of people in data, science and machine learning. Because you.

25
00:02:16.280 --> 00:02:20.660
Vikesh K: even when we open up an opening, there are too many applications.

26
00:02:20.760 --> 00:02:38.429
Vikesh K: And I believe that would be the same case, if you're already working in this, everyone wants to enter into this. This is hyped up. This is very hot field. That's also another reason you would be doing this course. But there's also a lot of interesting stuff which happens in this field. Hence

27
00:02:38.430 --> 00:02:52.499
Vikesh K: it's all worth it. Because if you if you like numbers. How I think about it being in a data science role, or a data analyst or a machine learning role, you try to develop a systematic and a quantitative understanding of your business.

28
00:02:52.940 --> 00:03:08.870
Vikesh K: You know you understand your customers in a mathematical sense. You know how they're behaving. When are they returning back? So everything you you try to understand those particularly in numbers, and and try to then model them. What's their behavior like? So

29
00:03:10.910 --> 00:03:34.159
Vikesh K: compared to other fields? For example, let's say, a software developer. There is. The learning curve is definitely way more steep because you also have to do a good amount of in addition to coding. You also need to know good amount of math statistics which can be challenging sometimes, you know, essentially, you have the whole base of probability, linear algebra calculus there and then you have the python

30
00:03:34.210 --> 00:03:35.749
Vikesh K: and and then

31
00:03:35.940 --> 00:03:57.160
Vikesh K: advanced algorithms on top of that. So that definitely makes it challenging. But that doesn't mean you really have to do a Phd. In maths and stats to do that? It would be good at least how I approach my officers, and how I would like to learn is, 1st you figure out how to drive a car, and then you start peeking into the engine because that works much better.

32
00:03:57.746 --> 00:04:02.630
Vikesh K: On the Internet. You will find all kinds of advice, I believe.

33
00:04:02.960 --> 00:04:07.489
Vikesh K: but you have to pick and choose. If you have the luxury and time to go back and learn

34
00:04:07.510 --> 00:04:19.519
Vikesh K: lean algebra calculus from scratch. That would be great. But I understand many of you can't do that. You would have some job or some other commitments. But the best way is, you learn you pick up stuff

35
00:04:20.149 --> 00:04:30.099
Vikesh K: while solving it through projects, and then, if you don't understand something, then you go deep into it and try to understand it. Further, it's more like just in time learning.

36
00:04:30.740 --> 00:04:48.199
Vikesh K: because I think that often works better. And then if you map it to a project. You will also retain the information for much longer time. Right? So, for example, you do 5. Classification project, 5, regression project, 5 time series project, and then you go to Nlp. And all you know you can think of your whole

37
00:04:48.280 --> 00:04:57.060
Vikesh K: journey in terms of, let's say, 5 5 projects. So you know you do 2025 projects. That would be a better way to retain information. Go deep into the

38
00:04:57.080 --> 00:05:04.809
Vikesh K: specific nuances, and that could also be good for your portfolio if you want to build a portfolio projects

39
00:05:06.240 --> 00:05:20.450
Vikesh K: other than that. Yeah, this is like high level. I think many of you would already know about this stuff. There's 1 topic which I wanted to talk about, which is interview. How interview happens. It can vary across industries, across companies.

40
00:05:20.510 --> 00:05:34.099
Vikesh K: But typically there would be a coding round. For example, you know we often send out a hacker rank link. You have to do some coding there. It might vary or be differ for a different company.

41
00:05:35.180 --> 00:05:38.629
Vikesh K: and after that, often in face to face rounds.

42
00:05:38.700 --> 00:06:00.959
Vikesh K: many of which happen over Zoom. Now you're given a business case or a situation, and you are, and and they don't really ask you, hey? Tell us the assumptions of linear regression, for example, or, you know, is linear regression. Sometimes they might ask, but at a junior level, but at a slightly advanced intermediate level, they would often give you situations or problem statements

43
00:06:01.550 --> 00:06:13.800
Vikesh K: rather than you know, typical cases. Okay, so it's it's good to practice with projects that that's 1 of the things I would highly encourage. And I will talk about, maybe where you can get some projects. I've already talked about it.

44
00:06:13.960 --> 00:06:15.450
Vikesh K: but now, as we

45
00:06:15.530 --> 00:06:17.950
Vikesh K: are entering into the

46
00:06:18.380 --> 00:06:23.119
Vikesh K: phase 3 slowly, you would have to do the capstone. So it's good

47
00:06:23.290 --> 00:06:27.629
Vikesh K: to, you know. Get an idea of all the different sources out there.

48
00:06:28.500 --> 00:06:37.100
Vikesh K: And the 3rd one is the personal activity, right, which, in any case, which is more of a behavioral round which all of you would have faced across the organizations.

49
00:06:37.550 --> 00:06:44.714
Vikesh K: Okay, I will take a pause here. See if you have any questions for me which which maybe you think I can help. But other than that

50
00:06:45.010 --> 00:06:48.490
Vikesh K: many of the things around this are pretty generic. Now.

51
00:06:49.420 --> 00:06:53.900
Vikesh K: domain knowledge deepak, I think, in some specific sectors it's quite crucial.

52
00:06:54.110 --> 00:07:00.169
Vikesh K: For example, let's say you want to do analytics or data science in supply chain

53
00:07:00.230 --> 00:07:09.020
Vikesh K: supply chain behaves very differently compared to let's say what you're doing in for a sas business, or for let's say what you're doing in

54
00:07:09.630 --> 00:07:10.809
Vikesh K: you know.

55
00:07:10.940 --> 00:07:12.040
Vikesh K: for booking.

56
00:07:12.180 --> 00:07:19.519
Vikesh K: So, for example, let's say, and within also, there are a couple of other things you need to know, for example, in if you are in supply chain analytics.

57
00:07:19.970 --> 00:07:21.860
Vikesh K: doing forecasting well

58
00:07:22.310 --> 00:07:24.360
Vikesh K: will become an important skill.

59
00:07:24.460 --> 00:07:30.700
Vikesh K: because you need to stock different products. So you need to know when to stock them and how much to stock them

60
00:07:30.950 --> 00:07:34.099
Vikesh K: to solve. Problems like that time series becomes very important.

61
00:07:34.270 --> 00:07:55.450
Vikesh K: But let's say, if you are doing something like customer lifetime value. Maybe time series is not very important, right? So so it depends on which particular what it will help you is to narrow down which skills you need to focus on right. So, for example, in this course, we devote

62
00:07:55.470 --> 00:08:04.609
Vikesh K: one chapter, one module time series. But if you're interested in a role or in an industry where Time series is very important. Maybe you might have to focus more on that.

63
00:08:06.830 --> 00:08:17.199
Vikesh K: I hope that answers your question deepak so. And again, a lot of it will depend on specific roles as you go, for example, deep into marketing. Also.

64
00:08:18.000 --> 00:08:19.389
Vikesh K: sometimes the rule.

65
00:08:19.520 --> 00:08:26.869
Vikesh K: ask and require that. You know, for example, how to model customer lifetime value. Right? So you need domain knowledge for that.

66
00:08:27.660 --> 00:08:30.800
Vikesh K: Okay, Carmen, you have raised your hand. Let's say, let's.

67
00:08:30.800 --> 00:08:40.350
Carmen P.: Yes, hey? Yes, I have 2 questions I posted in the chat. But my 1st question is like, What is the role of data science, especially in Gen. AI.

68
00:08:40.679 --> 00:08:45.049
Carmen P.: And the second question is, if you are not good at coding.

69
00:08:46.020 --> 00:08:49.999
Carmen P.: how can you break into artificial intelligence, product, management.

70
00:08:51.630 --> 00:08:54.702
Vikesh K: Okay. I, I can tell you from my experience

71
00:08:55.470 --> 00:08:56.230
Vikesh K: of

72
00:08:57.330 --> 00:08:59.755
Vikesh K: right now. There, there are,

73
00:09:00.400 --> 00:09:06.050
Vikesh K: some Gen. AI stuff happening at booking as well. There are a couple of things how we are doing it.

74
00:09:06.140 --> 00:09:07.370
Vikesh K: One is

75
00:09:07.440 --> 00:09:10.870
Vikesh K: we we want to do it. And let me do one thing.

76
00:09:12.230 --> 00:09:24.431
Ravi Duvvuri: I can read a book like the thing the things you suggested long back. So that's the one way. But showing off the credential if you think is a good way to, you know.

77
00:09:24.780 --> 00:09:30.180
Ravi Duvvuri: again. I don't want to spend money, you know, on that. So. But you know anything.

78
00:09:30.180 --> 00:09:34.810
Vikesh K: No make sense makes sense. So I I think one good course would be on Coursera. There is a

79
00:09:34.900 --> 00:09:46.110
Vikesh K: course by a statistics, Professor. I think it's called introduction to statistics, and that's quite good. And then, you know, you're doing a Berkeley course, and then you do a Stanford course. It looks good complementary, in a way.

80
00:09:46.190 --> 00:09:48.300
Vikesh K: So that's another course. You can do.

81
00:09:49.320 --> 00:09:51.109
Ravi Duvvuri: Introduction to statistics. That's what he.

82
00:09:51.110 --> 00:09:51.770
Vikesh K: Yeah.

83
00:09:52.860 --> 00:09:59.880
Vikesh K: I think it's an Intro level. And that guy teaches really, well, he's a Stats professor at Stanford, so that could be a good course.

84
00:10:00.070 --> 00:10:01.550
Vikesh K: and then

85
00:10:02.100 --> 00:10:03.450
Vikesh K: yes, Shashi, please.

86
00:10:03.860 --> 00:10:12.770
shashi: Yeah, Ravi, I can share. Have another link for introduction to statistics, which is a good course. I will share you the link directly.

87
00:10:13.140 --> 00:10:14.199
Ravi Duvvuri: Oh, sure. Yeah, thank you.

88
00:10:14.200 --> 00:10:16.530
Vikesh K: If you have the link, you can share it here, maybe others will.

89
00:10:16.530 --> 00:10:19.120
shashi: Okay. Okay. Then I'll share it. Here.

90
00:10:19.800 --> 00:10:20.789
Ravi Duvvuri: Sounds good. Thank you.

91
00:10:20.790 --> 00:10:27.259
Vikesh K: The other. With respect to experimentation, I think on at least on coursera. There's 1 by

92
00:10:29.130 --> 00:10:41.929
Vikesh K: University of San Diego. I think it's called designing experiments. So if someone is interested just in a B testing, that would be much more relevant that way. But if you want a general understanding of statistics. This

93
00:10:42.030 --> 00:10:44.630
Vikesh K: introduction to statistics course would be good.

94
00:10:46.200 --> 00:10:47.829
Vikesh K: cool Ravi. Yep.

95
00:10:47.830 --> 00:10:48.490
Ravi Duvvuri: Thank you.

96
00:10:50.020 --> 00:10:52.210
Vikesh K: Okay, so she.

97
00:10:52.880 --> 00:10:56.519
Ravi Duvvuri: Because can you put that San Diego one also on the chat like it's.

98
00:10:56.680 --> 00:10:57.590
Vikesh K: Yes.

99
00:11:01.090 --> 00:11:04.669
Vikesh K: I think it's called design of experiments. If I remember this correctly.

100
00:11:05.290 --> 00:11:07.920
Vikesh K: I think. Sushi! Oh, you! You replied to that

101
00:11:08.170 --> 00:11:09.700
Vikesh K: Carmen's question.

102
00:11:09.870 --> 00:11:10.590
Vikesh K: Okay.

103
00:11:10.950 --> 00:11:11.700
Vikesh K: cool.

104
00:11:12.700 --> 00:11:16.340
Vikesh K: Oh, this guy, yeah, this guy also has nice videos.

105
00:11:18.030 --> 00:11:19.789
Vikesh K: By the way, there's this one more guy called.

106
00:11:19.790 --> 00:11:22.310
shashi: Josh Starmer also does a good job.

107
00:11:22.310 --> 00:11:25.460
Vikesh K: Oh, yes, yes, that's what I was typing. Start quest.

108
00:11:26.124 --> 00:11:34.029
Vikesh K: It's amazing. Sometimes I think about it. There's so much material to learn that, you know. Now you will get confused with what should I proceed.

109
00:11:34.730 --> 00:11:35.563
Ravi Duvvuri: Yeah, exactly.

110
00:11:35.980 --> 00:11:53.939
Vikesh K: 10 years back. I think I remember when I think 1015 years back, when Khan Academy started, I was like, Wow, this is amazing how come this guy is putting up all this information. And then, after that, coursera came in 2011, and then things just you know, there was a full explosion of material after that.

111
00:11:54.410 --> 00:12:12.500
Vikesh K: But I think, yeah, even for starts. In fact, in one of the I think office hours, I will focus on a B testing. I will, because the professors talk about experimentation. They don't, really. We don't. Don't really go deep into that.

112
00:12:12.650 --> 00:12:22.269
Vikesh K: But I think I would. I would like to focus one case, study around that because I think that's quite useful. If if you pick up any of the

113
00:12:22.380 --> 00:12:30.060
Vikesh K: usual job descriptions, you will see that involves some amount of experimentation in the tech company, especially if you're developing around product

114
00:12:30.100 --> 00:12:34.690
Vikesh K: right? Which is customer facing. You need some.

115
00:12:34.740 --> 00:12:38.840
Vikesh K: A B testing some statistics, information around that

116
00:12:39.890 --> 00:12:43.959
Vikesh K: cool any other questions or doubts on that.

117
00:12:47.760 --> 00:12:50.160
Vikesh K: Okay, this is more or less the

118
00:12:50.720 --> 00:12:53.056
Vikesh K: places where you can get some practice.

119
00:12:53.540 --> 00:13:19.909
Vikesh K: you know, you have algorithmic practice. You have lead code project toilet. But I think lead code might be very helpful. If you want to go. It depends. Again, it depends company to companies. If you're looking for a machine learning engineer role, they expect you to. It's more like a software engineer. So they would give you lead code. But if it's more like a data scientist which is heavy on stats rather than heavy on coding, you don't have to put things in production.

120
00:13:19.910 --> 00:13:44.589
Vikesh K: The interview would be around some. Maybe, you know, statistics or basic python rather than lead code level questions. That's often the distinction. So if you're preparing for a data scientist or data analyst role don't really go. And you know, do all these coding exercises on lead code? And again, please make a list of the companies that you're applying for

121
00:13:44.690 --> 00:13:48.009
Vikesh K: and understand what's their process like? Because.

122
00:13:48.668 --> 00:13:51.360
Vikesh K: the the challenge with data sciences.

123
00:13:51.530 --> 00:13:58.569
Vikesh K: every company has their own process more or less. Some companies focus on SQL, some companies focus on python.

124
00:13:58.830 --> 00:14:01.416
Vikesh K: And yes, in fact, in fact, one more

125
00:14:02.060 --> 00:14:03.530
Vikesh K: advice would be

126
00:14:03.750 --> 00:14:12.810
Vikesh K: to focus on SQL. We don't cover SQL. In this course, but just having an understanding of databases and how it works would be quite helpful for you.

127
00:14:13.060 --> 00:14:21.589
Vikesh K: In fact, even the you know, the fancy tech companies like Open AI right now. Openai, I remember, had a data scientist opening.

128
00:14:21.790 --> 00:14:28.739
Vikesh K: I think, couple of months back. Only thing they asked essentially, was 5 years of experience. And then python and SQL,

129
00:14:28.830 --> 00:14:33.110
Vikesh K: and some, I think, A. B testing because they were developing, improving their product.

130
00:14:33.180 --> 00:14:49.239
Vikesh K: So some product knowledge. So even the company which makes Llm. Which has Llm. As a business, not necessarily wants you to know. Llm. You know, when you apply to that company. So the challenge with the Llm. Is, it's all over the place now. It's much hyped.

131
00:14:49.500 --> 00:14:56.069
Vikesh K: Everyone wants to talk about Llm. But the companies are still not mature enough to use Llms.

132
00:14:57.440 --> 00:15:05.309
Vikesh K: one thing where one application which we have started using very recently, and maybe maybe I'm not sure how many of you know about it? It's called Glean

133
00:15:06.658 --> 00:15:13.289
Vikesh K: It started by ex software engineer, or from

134
00:15:13.430 --> 00:15:16.210
Vikesh K: from Google. He used to work on the search there.

135
00:15:16.350 --> 00:15:21.590
Vikesh K: and he started another company after leaving Google, and then he realized his.

136
00:15:21.610 --> 00:15:24.960
Vikesh K: And you know the internal documentation of the company is a mess.

137
00:15:25.000 --> 00:15:27.600
Vikesh K: So he started a company glean

138
00:15:27.620 --> 00:15:39.520
Vikesh K: which actually does Llms quite well. So, for example, we have so many docs floating around, you can ask it to summarize, and the key takeaways and everything that does it very well

139
00:15:39.680 --> 00:15:47.759
Vikesh K: now, so it's think about it as Chat gpt. But for your internal company documents, and that that's that can be very useful.

140
00:15:47.890 --> 00:15:48.920
Vikesh K: So

141
00:15:49.500 --> 00:15:56.710
Vikesh K: yeah, that's that's 1 1 space where I think. Llms have made my life easy but other than that.

142
00:15:57.250 --> 00:16:04.379
Kiran: Glenn is coming up with another Llm. Or they were using Llms to do their documentation perfect.

143
00:16:04.380 --> 00:16:07.270
Vikesh K: They do 2 things very well. First, st they

144
00:16:07.460 --> 00:16:11.230
Vikesh K: any. I don't know how they have managed it in the back end, but

145
00:16:12.260 --> 00:16:37.219
Vikesh K: anything which any document which is linked inside the company, you can actually source it very easily. It's like Google, search on your internal company's database. So if there is a Jira ticket. If there is a file in Google Docs, is there any email? Is there any presentation? You put the topic? You will get it? And it's amazing. So that's the 1st step. The second thing what it can do is.

146
00:16:37.230 --> 00:16:46.820
Vikesh K: you know, you tag a particular document, and you ask, Hey, summarize the key points for me and tell me the next action items. I actually did it. Recently we had a meeting with one of my directors.

147
00:16:46.850 --> 00:17:00.290
Vikesh K: What I did. I had presented some document to him, and I asked the glean to, you know, tell me the action points based on it which, which, as a data team we should do, and it gives some incredible insights.

148
00:17:00.570 --> 00:17:01.680
Vikesh K: So

149
00:17:01.880 --> 00:17:05.760
Vikesh K: so glean is quite so glean is a combination of 2, 1. It it

150
00:17:06.040 --> 00:17:16.670
Vikesh K: does what Google does for you. You know it crawls it, it indexes all your documents, and then, you know, then it works like a chat Gpt, so it's a combination of 2 for both, for us

151
00:17:16.880 --> 00:17:18.402
Vikesh K: very, very useful.

152
00:17:19.160 --> 00:17:25.879
Kiran: And another question. Maybe I missed when you explain about what is a big testing I didn't get

153
00:17:26.200 --> 00:17:29.646
Vikesh K: Okay? Sure. Okay. So so I I can show you within

154
00:17:30.300 --> 00:17:30.800
Vikesh K: But

155
00:17:32.070 --> 00:17:32.980
Vikesh K: chart.

156
00:17:34.010 --> 00:17:37.950
Vikesh K: Or maybe I can also send you a case show you with the case today.

157
00:17:38.450 --> 00:17:41.330
Vikesh K: Just give me one second. Let me

158
00:17:44.600 --> 00:17:46.260
Vikesh K: let me think of a

159
00:17:47.960 --> 00:17:49.430
Vikesh K: which I can share.

160
00:17:52.080 --> 00:17:59.870
Kiran: In in house. We are doing some A B testing what we're our Ab testing is comparing release a release. B, and what is the.

161
00:17:59.870 --> 00:18:00.529
Vikesh K: That's different.

162
00:18:00.530 --> 00:18:01.780
Kiran: In any Clna.

163
00:18:01.810 --> 00:18:02.683
Kiran: So I

164
00:18:03.300 --> 00:18:09.380
Kiran: it's it's correlate to what I'm doing some. But I'm I don't know what you are talking about. with regards to Ab testing.

165
00:18:09.570 --> 00:18:17.310
Vikesh K: Okay, let me. So I've I will also share this case study with all of you. So you know, later on, if you want to practice, you can do it. This is

166
00:18:17.670 --> 00:18:21.400
Vikesh K: similar to the officer case studies. But

167
00:18:21.750 --> 00:18:27.660
Vikesh K: okay, so often, what happens? Let's say you want to make a improvement to a product. Okay, so

168
00:18:28.350 --> 00:18:41.279
Vikesh K: in this case, this, this simple image, you can see this is one layout. And this is one layout, right? And someone, let's say they change the color in the bottom. You know of some certain sections in the website.

169
00:18:41.420 --> 00:18:42.270
Vikesh K: Now.

170
00:18:42.420 --> 00:18:47.540
Vikesh K: as a designer or as a you know, you have to figure out which version works the best for you.

171
00:18:48.330 --> 00:18:49.909
Vikesh K: And what you do.

172
00:18:49.930 --> 00:18:57.839
Vikesh K: you basically, let's say, 100 people are coming to a website. 50 people would be shown version A, 50 people would be shown version B,

173
00:18:57.970 --> 00:19:11.390
Vikesh K: and then you've observed their behavior and see how they actually, you know, behave on your website, how they interact with your website and the version which has better metrics, you roll it out.

174
00:19:11.880 --> 00:19:19.700
Vikesh K: So most of the product decisions that companies are taken like this, especially if you have a front end. If you have a customer facing website. So whether it's an apps

175
00:19:19.810 --> 00:19:21.630
Vikesh K: or it's a.

176
00:19:22.240 --> 00:19:27.520
Vikesh K: it's a website decisions are taken via A, B testing.

177
00:19:28.220 --> 00:19:37.929
Avinash Gangwal: Hey, Vikesh, I have a question. And it's it's a problem or challenge. I'm facing right now. I'm starting my own company.

178
00:19:38.170 --> 00:19:39.210
Avinash Gangwal: So

179
00:19:39.888 --> 00:19:42.530
Avinash Gangwal: basically, we need to do.

180
00:19:42.640 --> 00:19:44.609
Avinash Gangwal: we need to decide

181
00:19:44.840 --> 00:19:50.419
Avinash Gangwal: which kind of prototype Mvp, we should build either web

182
00:19:50.430 --> 00:19:53.870
Avinash Gangwal: or the mobile app and do the Ib testing.

183
00:19:53.960 --> 00:19:55.865
Avinash Gangwal: The purpose is

184
00:19:56.730 --> 00:20:01.010
Avinash Gangwal: basically, we need to make sure that what we are building

185
00:20:01.100 --> 00:20:07.919
Avinash Gangwal: is what user like, right? So how do I decide whether I should go for web.

186
00:20:08.330 --> 00:20:13.589
Avinash Gangwal: I should go for mobile app. I know that web building web is faster and easy.

187
00:20:13.770 --> 00:20:19.619
Avinash Gangwal: but I same time I know that most of my user will be the mobile app user.

188
00:20:21.620 --> 00:20:22.819
Vikesh K: Okay, interesting.

189
00:20:23.060 --> 00:20:42.759
Vikesh K: So avinash, I don't think I'm like the best position to answer. This is more of a high level product level question. But having if if I were at your position, what I how I will approach it is, obviously you won't have any data for customers right now, right? Because you don't have anything launched. So the best thing is, you design something.

190
00:20:42.830 --> 00:20:49.710
Vikesh K: and with the best you know, let's say you have a designer who knows who has worked in some other company, and he knows he or she knows the best principles

191
00:20:49.740 --> 00:21:11.149
Vikesh K: you design around that, and sometimes you can even copy. You know some other website and see how it works. For you. You know, design elements from some other website which you really like. Copy those elements and test it. And then you start iterating because without any data, you can't do any ab testing, you need to have good amount of data. And also the challenge with a B testing is.

192
00:21:12.400 --> 00:21:13.830
Vikesh K: you need enough

193
00:21:13.930 --> 00:21:15.530
Vikesh K: sample size?

194
00:21:16.497 --> 00:21:18.369
Vikesh K: You know, your sample should be in.

195
00:21:18.480 --> 00:21:30.560
Vikesh K: For example, Google can do it very easily. Google has lots of traffic. So even if they run an experiment for one day, they might have sufficient data for it. But for us we might have to do it for a week.

196
00:21:30.630 --> 00:21:32.720
Vikesh K: You might have to do it for 2, 3 months.

197
00:21:33.140 --> 00:21:45.989
Vikesh K: So the initial part, I don't think you need to focus on Ab testing right now at all, it's it's more like you develop what you think is the best design principles. And then, later on, you optimize it, at least, so within booking.

198
00:21:46.090 --> 00:21:47.400
Vikesh K: Okay, let me.

199
00:21:47.870 --> 00:21:50.600
Vikesh K: But this was good and all the best for your startup.

200
00:21:51.430 --> 00:21:59.920
Avinash Gangwal: Thank you. Yeah. I worked in big tech firm for 20 years. Apple Gs, and finally I decided to quit

201
00:22:00.050 --> 00:22:01.539
Avinash Gangwal: 2, 3 months back.

202
00:22:02.483 --> 00:22:05.660
Avinash Gangwal: And I thought, I'll just do something my own.

203
00:22:05.950 --> 00:22:06.830
Avinash Gangwal: So.

204
00:22:07.260 --> 00:22:17.170
Vikesh K: Well, that takes a lot of courage, lovely and all the best. Hopefully. Maybe tomorrow, when things become big, you can. All the peers who are in this course, you know, if they require a job you can.

205
00:22:17.260 --> 00:22:18.689
Vikesh K: You can do it. You can.

206
00:22:18.690 --> 00:22:21.819
Avinash Gangwal: I wish. I wish that it happens.

207
00:22:22.840 --> 00:22:24.560
Vikesh K: And that's that's luxurious.

208
00:22:24.560 --> 00:22:29.299
Avinash Gangwal: But yeah, it's a long journey. It's just beginning, and we'll see.

209
00:22:29.650 --> 00:22:30.299
Vikesh K: Okay. Okay.

210
00:22:30.300 --> 00:22:35.610
Avinash Gangwal: That's why this course is helping me a lot in thinking more in terms of.

211
00:22:35.760 --> 00:22:41.679
Avinash Gangwal: because my product has a aiml flavor to it. And this is helping me

212
00:22:41.770 --> 00:22:45.550
Avinash Gangwal: to understand, though I'll not do coding as such.

213
00:22:45.600 --> 00:22:48.850
Avinash Gangwal: But it is giving me good idea that

214
00:22:49.200 --> 00:22:51.839
Avinash Gangwal: I should do, and how I should do it.

215
00:22:52.440 --> 00:23:00.490
Vikesh K: Okay, okay, well, that's lovely. That's good to know. So, Avina, just one book which I would recommend for that is something called lean analytics. That's a very good book.

216
00:23:01.110 --> 00:23:06.109
Vikesh K: If you have heard of all this lean series, it was written in the same

217
00:23:06.360 --> 00:23:13.660
Vikesh K: manner. But it's a very good book. It's, it's basically how you can use the customer data to make some actionable impacts, you know, especially at the start.

218
00:23:14.030 --> 00:23:15.439
Vikesh K: So this might be useful.

219
00:23:19.450 --> 00:23:21.129
Avinash Gangwal: Okay. Lean analytics.

220
00:23:21.130 --> 00:23:23.350
Vikesh K: Yes, I put it in the chat as well. The name

221
00:23:23.460 --> 00:23:28.730
Vikesh K: it's written by 2 folks, and they have a couple of Youtube videos. So even if you don't have time to go through the whole book.

222
00:23:29.535 --> 00:23:31.900
Vikesh K: Youtube videos would be good enough starting point

223
00:23:33.220 --> 00:23:41.662
Vikesh K: alright. So, by the way, this is this is I've I've sent this. If you're curious about Ab testing, you can attempt this

224
00:23:42.340 --> 00:23:53.120
Vikesh K: assignment. And, for example, what this is, what this talks about. There's a 2 different kind of landing pages, old landing page, and a new landing page, and you. They would have given you data on for both of them.

225
00:23:53.170 --> 00:24:02.509
Vikesh K: and what they want to understand is how so, for example, this is the main metric. There are 2 main metrics, but one of the main metrics is how many people got converted.

226
00:24:02.850 --> 00:24:05.100
Vikesh K: So you care about conversion a lot.

227
00:24:05.340 --> 00:24:16.270
Vikesh K: And you know conversion can mean different things at different companies. But you care about conversion. And then you see which version leads to a higher conversion.

228
00:24:16.470 --> 00:24:22.340
Vikesh K: Right? So that's how you be testing is done, or you can maybe focus on the time spent on the web page.

229
00:24:22.780 --> 00:24:25.000
Vikesh K: All right, that could be another component.

230
00:24:25.050 --> 00:24:29.740
Vikesh K: So these are the business decisions which you will take day in, day out.

231
00:24:30.070 --> 00:24:47.910
Vikesh K: especially if you're working in a tech company. Now, how interestingly, for example, how machine learning gets integrated with this is, let's say, tomorrow you come up with a new ranking algorithm or a new recommendation system. Algorithm customer comes to your website. You recommend them something.

232
00:24:47.980 --> 00:25:04.579
Vikesh K: And how do you figure out which recommendation system works best for the customers, and that's where Ab testing comes into picture. So you have one status quo recommendation. Then you let's say you come up with a new algorithms. And you think it does a better job.

233
00:25:04.790 --> 00:25:09.400
Vikesh K: So you A B test both the versions and see which version works the best.

234
00:25:09.930 --> 00:25:15.160
Vikesh K: And this requires more statistics, you know, knowing your tea test, Anova.

235
00:25:15.210 --> 00:25:33.960
Vikesh K: that would be much more helpful in this domain which we don't really cover a lot in this course because the focus is on machine learning. It's a field in itself. But I would say, especially if you're looking for jobs, or if you want to work for a tech company is good to have understanding of basics of a B testing and experimentation.

236
00:25:35.220 --> 00:25:36.030
Vikesh K: Okay?

237
00:25:36.350 --> 00:25:37.290
Vikesh K: And

238
00:25:37.920 --> 00:25:42.419
Vikesh K: the main, just one more point. The main guy who talks a little

239
00:25:43.370 --> 00:25:57.599
Vikesh K: very nicely about this is called is his name is Ron Cohavi. I I hope I pronounce it correctly. He used to work with Amazon, then Microsoft, then Airbnb, and now he leads independent. He's he works like a consultant now.

240
00:25:57.870 --> 00:26:02.170
Vikesh K: but he has good stuff around A B testing. So that might be useful.

241
00:26:03.610 --> 00:26:04.500
Vikesh K: Okay.

242
00:26:05.030 --> 00:26:22.479
Vikesh K: any other questions or doubts around this. I want to keep it free, open ended, or have all of you. I know this is still very start. Many of you may not have looked at the practical application, but this practical application is slightly tricky. Like Shashi already said there would be some data cleaning you would require to do.

243
00:26:22.980 --> 00:26:24.310
Vikesh K: And then

244
00:26:24.330 --> 00:26:35.019
Vikesh K: you feel free to use other algorithm which you haven't covered in the course, but I believe right now the expectation is you will use mostly linear regression and polynomial, and

245
00:26:35.150 --> 00:26:38.049
Vikesh K: I think the last vendor reach. That's the

246
00:26:38.170 --> 00:26:46.779
Vikesh K: sort of expectation as of now, because we haven't covered other advanced algorithms which we are going to cover in the course.

247
00:26:48.577 --> 00:27:00.200
Zhujun Wang: I have a question. So I'm a software engineer before, mostly working for the infra. But just recently, we, we use the chat. Gpt.

248
00:27:00.200 --> 00:27:19.629
Zhujun Wang: mostly Api. But build a use, use a launching to build a AI agent. So so I actually say, I'm thinking right now, if you want to switch to more like machine learning engineer like you say, for the prepare for the like, coding for the for the like machine learning engineer like, say, what's the

249
00:27:20.060 --> 00:27:48.799
Zhujun Wang: The decoding difficulty level does it require? And also just for my experience as being software engineer for many like, roughly like 10 years. And then recently, my projects heavily related to AI agent. So in in my case, may I like like, I say, maybe next year I want to switch the job. May I directly apply for the machine learning engineer, or after complete this course and any suggestion.

250
00:27:50.450 --> 00:28:17.029
Vikesh K: Okay. So regarding, I believe, you know, for the software engineer level, the kind of lead code you would be preparing, I think that should suffice. Usually it's at the same level or below it. I don't think you it's it's harder than that, but depends on the company as well. Right machine learning. I would also say, Check out Jane Street. Jane Street pays very well for a machine learning engineer, if you're interested in that. But if you are focused on.

251
00:28:17.060 --> 00:28:24.100
Vikesh K: But if you're focused on the consumer side, for example, you know, companies like Airbnb booking expedia.

252
00:28:24.600 --> 00:28:25.260
Vikesh K: No.

253
00:28:25.860 --> 00:28:35.380
Vikesh K: the second to talk thing you talked about is what what additional should you do? I think one thing you can look into this is again a course developed by

254
00:28:36.014 --> 00:28:36.884
Vikesh K: Berkeley guys

255
00:28:37.570 --> 00:28:40.059
Vikesh K: it's called full stack. Deep learning.

256
00:28:41.409 --> 00:28:42.000
Zhujun Wang: Okay.

257
00:28:42.000 --> 00:28:48.210
Vikesh K: Why this is helpful is because the whole focus is on using deep learning

258
00:28:48.430 --> 00:28:49.569
Vikesh K: to make a product.

259
00:28:50.100 --> 00:29:00.010
Vikesh K: So maybe that might give you a better. And and you know, then it's all about deployment Mlops couple of those things they touch upon. So I think that would be way more helpful.

260
00:29:00.160 --> 00:29:13.030
Vikesh K: This course is more of a theoretical understanding. So many companies. They also have machine learning scientist role and machine learning engineers, role machine learning engineers need to know all this machine learning, but their focus is main on the deployment part.

261
00:29:13.280 --> 00:29:13.840
Vikesh K: So.

262
00:29:13.840 --> 00:29:14.410
Zhujun Wang: Gotcha.

263
00:29:14.410 --> 00:29:22.509
Vikesh K: So. So I think this course would be good enough for you to understand what's happening in the world, but I think you might have to supplement it with some

264
00:29:22.820 --> 00:29:24.890
Vikesh K: Mlops course, so.

265
00:29:24.890 --> 00:29:25.640
Zhujun Wang: Got y'all.

266
00:29:25.640 --> 00:29:31.700
Vikesh K: So there is a lady called Chip Hugh Wayne. I I'm not sure if I pronounce her name correctly.

267
00:29:31.750 --> 00:29:39.499
Vikesh K: She has written a very good book on machine learning operations. Maybe you can refer to that. That would be a good complement to the course.

268
00:29:39.800 --> 00:29:45.069
Vikesh K: and she used to teach at Stanford. So her materials available online.

269
00:29:45.800 --> 00:29:48.609
Vikesh K: And that's that's pretty good material, I think.

270
00:29:49.440 --> 00:29:56.300
Vikesh K: in terms of doing machine learning. Mlops Stanford has one of the best material out there. The

271
00:29:56.500 --> 00:30:03.869
Vikesh K: and I think Cmu might have some material online. Cmu has one course around that. But I'm not sure of others.

272
00:30:04.090 --> 00:30:05.510
Vikesh K: This could be helpful, but.

273
00:30:06.990 --> 00:30:07.470
Zhujun Wang: Gotcha.

274
00:30:07.470 --> 00:30:08.270
Vikesh K: Same question.

275
00:30:09.450 --> 00:30:10.959
Vikash: Yeah, I had one question.

276
00:30:11.180 --> 00:30:12.000
Vikash: Yes, we.

277
00:30:12.300 --> 00:30:18.780
Vikash: So I. My question was like, I have lot of customer experience. But I've been working with customer on customer side.

278
00:30:18.850 --> 00:30:30.269
Vikash: So in AI feel like a lot of product, companies are there, but the are there roles for, like customer architect who is knowledgeable on AI, but wants to work with customers.

279
00:30:32.523 --> 00:30:35.200
Vikesh K: At least, because this is I have no clue on that.

280
00:30:35.500 --> 00:30:44.869
Vikesh K: I won't be able to. I I'm not sure I'm at least in booking. So my my exposures to couple of companies there I haven't heard, and also because

281
00:30:44.920 --> 00:30:48.579
Vikesh K: I've never explored this kind of role or checked about it.

282
00:30:48.720 --> 00:30:52.300
Vikesh K: So I don't think I would be the best person to answer this.

283
00:30:52.630 --> 00:30:53.170
Vikesh K: Sorry.

284
00:30:54.770 --> 00:31:00.087
Vikesh K: but I'm guessing there would be some companies who required, especially maybe, in consulting, and all

285
00:31:00.420 --> 00:31:11.509
Vikash: No, actually for Saas companies. All the Sas companies have this kind of roles because this their customers are enterprise clients, so they need somebody who who can communicate with the customers and can

286
00:31:12.043 --> 00:31:15.929
Vikash: all these Saas companies has customer outcomes as one of their

287
00:31:16.778 --> 00:31:23.481
Vikash: teams, and that's where I was looking. That does. AI companies also has this kind of

288
00:31:24.070 --> 00:31:24.990
Vikash: teams.

289
00:31:26.140 --> 00:31:29.352
Vikesh K: They might, they definitely would have something like that.

290
00:31:29.820 --> 00:31:34.882
Vikesh K: I think maybe you know the the new companies like anthropic they have. They have all these.

291
00:31:35.310 --> 00:31:41.689
Vikesh K: you know, they are also tying up with clients. For example, glean I mentioned, maybe glean has something a role like that.

292
00:31:42.168 --> 00:31:46.949
Vikesh K: I've never worked with a Saas company. Hence, maybe that's why I wasn't aware of it.

293
00:31:47.540 --> 00:31:55.539
Vikesh K: But I'm pretty sure companies like glean. I will just put the name again, glean might have a role like this. And it's us based.

294
00:31:57.200 --> 00:32:00.259
Vikesh K: Yeah, other than that. My information is very limited in this.

295
00:32:01.650 --> 00:32:03.719
Vikesh K: Thanks. Well, thank you for your question.

296
00:32:05.655 --> 00:32:18.450
Zhujun Wang: Vikash, I just quick ask quick, quick! Like, follow up question. So for the machine learning engineer, because when I working as a software engineer. I'm also helping the scientist

297
00:32:18.630 --> 00:32:24.519
Zhujun Wang: like a applied scientist team to build a like a data ingestion pipeline

298
00:32:24.610 --> 00:32:29.710
Zhujun Wang: for for that. I'm just wondering does like those like ingestion

299
00:32:29.790 --> 00:32:40.860
Zhujun Wang: machine learning. Pipeline is the kind of one major job is major job responsibility for the machine learning engineer. Well, actually, machine machine learning engineers

300
00:32:40.890 --> 00:32:54.129
Zhujun Wang: will do more more role. Like, for example, just like our assignment, analyze the data, apply for the right, maybe algorithm or right machine learning tool to deal with it. Not just

301
00:32:54.290 --> 00:33:08.209
Zhujun Wang: not just like building the machine, learning pipeline that that could be could be complete done by the software engineer. Right? I just want to see what's the kind of what's the major difference between a software engineer role and the machine learning engineer.

302
00:33:09.670 --> 00:33:10.430
Vikesh K: I think.

303
00:33:10.700 --> 00:33:38.930
Vikesh K: at least on I can. I can tell you from my booking experience a. We have very specialized role then. You know. Obviously, within your work, for example, you will. Sometimes you might have to do some data exploration, or you might have to develop a model. But the role is sort of a little defined. Yeah, that's that's the advantage of working with big companies. You can focus on one particular domain right in startups, they will make you do everything.

304
00:33:39.030 --> 00:33:47.139
Vikesh K: So the smaller the company they will make you do everything, but the bigger the company, the rules become, much more specialized and they become narrow.

305
00:33:47.240 --> 00:33:48.560
Vikesh K: So

306
00:33:49.650 --> 00:33:56.904
Vikesh K: for us, specifically, I think the machine learning engineers are in teams like ranking. They are team in teams like recommendation

307
00:33:57.370 --> 00:33:58.800
Vikesh K: engine team.

308
00:33:58.900 --> 00:34:02.309
Vikesh K: That's where most of the Ml. Engineers are, or fraud detection.

309
00:34:02.460 --> 00:34:13.440
Vikesh K: These 3 are the major places where we at least we have machine learning engineers, at least for us. Software engineers are in everything because you have a at least in booking. You have a

310
00:34:13.699 --> 00:34:20.930
Vikesh K: front end guy and a back end guy, and sometimes those full stack guys. So all of them are in everything.

311
00:34:21.330 --> 00:34:30.659
Vikesh K: And I usually think this is like a pyramid. So the base, which is all the not pyramid, not in terms of hierarchy, but in terms of how roles are there software engineers the big

312
00:34:30.699 --> 00:34:56.519
Vikesh K: base, because every company requires many software engineers. Then you have some of these, let's say data scientists. Pm's also become narrow machine learning engineers are also a little narrow, right? Because if you are developing 4 or 5 models. You just maybe need one machine learning engineers to deploy that depending on the scale of your organization. Obviously. But for companies like Google. I'm pretty sure this would be very big for us. Also, it's a big team, like.

313
00:34:56.530 --> 00:34:58.340
Vikesh K: I think our data team is around

314
00:34:58.480 --> 00:34:59.939
Vikesh K: 2 to 300 people

315
00:35:00.130 --> 00:35:05.090
Vikesh K: like all the data. And I think then, if if we include data engineers, it might become

316
00:35:05.160 --> 00:35:09.389
Vikesh K: 3, 50, or something, right? But but that's required because you have different components.

317
00:35:09.630 --> 00:35:13.540
Vikesh K: And then that role focuses on one particular aspect.

318
00:35:14.290 --> 00:35:39.220
Zhujun Wang: Gotcha gotcha. Then last question from interview perspective, like, say, for the software engineer. Usually we do the coding and assistant design. It's our major interview. However, if a if for the machine learning engineer like say for for the interview, like, do we have a like, maybe, like additional around. Say, like a machine learning knowledge, deep dive, or something like that, yeah.

319
00:35:39.220 --> 00:35:44.840
Vikesh K: I'm pretty sure. Yeah, that that usually gets added. And also system design becomes a part of it.

320
00:35:44.930 --> 00:35:49.420
Vikesh K: By the way, the the guy, the byte byte code. The guy who runs that.

321
00:35:50.170 --> 00:35:51.370
Vikesh K: I think that's the

322
00:35:52.090 --> 00:35:54.650
Vikesh K: bite. Byte. Go, I believe that's the website.

323
00:35:54.910 --> 00:36:02.599
Vikesh K: Yes, this this guy has the whole team have have produced a book on machine learning engineering interviews.

324
00:36:02.860 --> 00:36:04.860
Vikesh K: Okay, let me quickly.

325
00:36:06.580 --> 00:36:07.990
Vikesh K: That could be a.

326
00:36:08.970 --> 00:36:11.410
Vikesh K: This is a system design. Ml.

327
00:36:11.880 --> 00:36:14.109
Zhujun Wang: I'm now system design, gotcha.

328
00:36:14.110 --> 00:36:17.379
Vikesh K: Yes, they have a good book on this. Yes, I think

329
00:36:18.800 --> 00:36:21.999
Vikesh K: maybe this is something which can be more helpful for you.

330
00:36:22.290 --> 00:36:22.760
Zhujun Wang: Gotcha.

331
00:36:22.760 --> 00:36:35.370
Vikesh K: Want to focus on this thing because he talks about different kind of problem statements out there, you know where machine engineering is required. And then the whole book is around those. But like this is a good way to learn. You know how.

332
00:36:35.370 --> 00:36:36.100
Zhujun Wang: Gotcha.

333
00:36:36.100 --> 00:36:37.330
Vikesh K: How do you deploy it?

334
00:36:37.660 --> 00:36:38.430
Vikesh K: Right?

335
00:36:38.770 --> 00:36:45.320
Vikesh K: I think we have one chapter for free. So I think you can get that one chapter for free or somewhere, and then you can purchase this.

336
00:36:45.740 --> 00:36:48.650
Zhujun Wang: Gotcha sounds good. We appreciate it. Cool.

337
00:36:48.840 --> 00:36:49.550
Vikesh K: Lovely.

338
00:36:50.310 --> 00:36:51.200
Vikesh K: Okay.

339
00:36:51.610 --> 00:36:54.010
Vikesh K: Deepak, you have raised your hand.

340
00:36:54.010 --> 00:36:56.050
Deepak: Hi! Vacation. Can you hear me?

341
00:36:56.050 --> 00:36:57.970
Vikesh K: Yes, yes, I can.

342
00:36:57.970 --> 00:37:11.509
Deepak: So no like considering. Like I'm for example, I'm a system engineer for last whatever 15 years, working mostly in the big Telco companies. Designing the wireless system 4G. And 5G. System.

343
00:37:11.550 --> 00:37:27.569
Deepak: Now for me like work around Nokia Samsung, and so on. Right for me. Somebody like me, I mean, what do you suggest from? So of course, the takeaway from this course is definitely working on the data. And networks do have a lot of data, right?

344
00:37:27.590 --> 00:37:34.332
Deepak: Real time data that comes from from the all the users across the nation and across the world. But

345
00:37:34.720 --> 00:37:41.510
Deepak: so just purely working on data is one thing. But what do you suggest me to go in terms of as a mentor, to go

346
00:37:41.770 --> 00:37:49.900
Deepak: like either? Look for the same telecom role domain role. But in with respect to working with the machine learning

347
00:37:50.457 --> 00:37:52.409
Deepak: or or should the

348
00:37:52.430 --> 00:37:58.550
Deepak: completely go as a machine learning data, data, scientist kind of role which is irrespective of domain.

349
00:37:59.600 --> 00:38:17.819
Vikesh K: Okay, Deepak, I would say, that's a tough question. Primarily, because you have a very Ni, like, you have a very specific and niche domain knowledge which I have no clue about, so I won't be able to talk about whether like, you know. Let's say there's a telecom company where has a machine learning engineer role or data scientist role

350
00:38:18.240 --> 00:38:32.860
Vikesh K: on paper? Definitely, that would be better fit for you. For example, let's say you and me apply for that. I'm pretty sure you will get selected. I won't get selected because I don't have the domain knowledge. I don't understand industry. Well, right? So you have a clear advantage there.

351
00:38:35.320 --> 00:38:44.180
Vikesh K: but I'm not sure how me, how the industry looks like, which are the key players, and I believe you're in us which are the key players in us. What kind of roles they have?

352
00:38:44.300 --> 00:38:45.420
Vikesh K: So

353
00:38:45.620 --> 00:38:46.240
Vikesh K: that's my.

354
00:38:46.240 --> 00:38:59.370
Deepak: Sure. Yeah, okay, my, my question is mostly, of course, I mean not in terms of the domain, but mainly to like what should be your suggestion. Should I look at within my domain, or should I look at in a general.

355
00:38:59.370 --> 00:39:05.629
Vikesh K: I think, within domain it would be easy. Because, yeah, why? I'm telling you, because right now the market is bit brutal.

356
00:39:05.850 --> 00:39:06.190
Deepak: -

357
00:39:06.501 --> 00:39:26.420
Vikesh K: Whether it's in us, whether it's in Europe. I have folks. Friends in us. Market is brutal everywhere right now, so it might be better to take advantage of your domain knowledge. Because if you let's say you try to get into a company which is focused on marketing analytics, right? So let's say, I'm showing you different kind of problem statements here

358
00:39:26.480 --> 00:39:35.649
Vikesh K: in this website. So let's say, want you want to do add click or something. So they might prefer someone or go for someone who already has a background in it

359
00:39:35.830 --> 00:39:41.770
Vikesh K: have have worked on these kind of problems. That's that that will be some advantage which these people bring in.

360
00:39:42.160 --> 00:39:43.150
Vikesh K: So

361
00:39:43.680 --> 00:39:47.959
Vikesh K: I think the most. Whenever, especially, you're changing your, you know track.

362
00:39:48.400 --> 00:39:51.999
Vikesh K: So within telecom moving to

363
00:39:52.380 --> 00:39:58.770
Vikesh K: data, science would be much more easier rather than you know, just outright changing companies and changing your domain completely.

364
00:39:59.610 --> 00:40:07.670
Vikesh K: So you have to move adjacently, and especially this becomes even more tough, as you gain more experience, because then people start bucketing you in one particular domain.

365
00:40:07.800 --> 00:40:28.680
Vikesh K: and sometimes they're not very, you know. It all depends on companies. And right now it's an employer market right now. Companies have too many applications, so they can pick and choose very easily. If you ever asked me. Maybe this 2, 3 years back things would have been different. Things were different previously. But now it's the market is very brutal.

366
00:40:29.210 --> 00:40:30.420
Vikesh K: so.

367
00:40:30.420 --> 00:40:32.590
Deepak: Makes sense. Thank you. Thanks. Rikesh.

368
00:40:32.810 --> 00:40:33.620
Vikesh K: Thank you.

369
00:40:34.800 --> 00:40:39.479
Vikesh K: Preeti. Coming to your question, you know again I have limited.

370
00:40:40.150 --> 00:40:42.416
Vikesh K: I I started by the way I started.

371
00:40:42.970 --> 00:40:51.430
Vikesh K: you know my 1st job was in finance, and then I used to focus on Pharma, and especially healthcare. I was in investment banking before I went for my master's

372
00:40:52.186 --> 00:40:53.893
Vikesh K: but I don't.

373
00:40:54.410 --> 00:41:00.249
Vikesh K: I have other than that. I don't have much exposure on this. I had one friend working for Novartis.

374
00:41:00.730 --> 00:41:18.609
Vikesh K: but he was, was it? Noatis? No, no, not this, no, not this. No company which make that which made that drug. And it's it's a big company now, I think Danish company, but I think he usually worked on some. You know more on the data analytics side

375
00:41:19.424 --> 00:41:26.160
Vikesh K: so I am not really sure of aiml roles. I know some specialized companies who are working on.

376
00:41:26.720 --> 00:41:30.569
Vikesh K: you know, one of the guys who wrote this transformer paper

377
00:41:31.570 --> 00:41:37.199
Vikesh K: attention is all you need. He started his own Biochemistry company.

378
00:41:37.210 --> 00:41:39.449
Vikesh K: and they are working at the Rna level.

379
00:41:39.570 --> 00:41:42.920
Vikesh K: So but again, that's a domain I have no clue about, so I won't be able to.

380
00:41:42.920 --> 00:41:43.990
Preeti Dubey: No make sense.

381
00:41:43.990 --> 00:41:47.519
Vikesh K: Genomic. Yeah, yeah. So usually, that's where a lot of em will get supplied.

382
00:41:47.520 --> 00:41:47.920
Preeti Dubey: Yes.

383
00:41:47.920 --> 00:41:54.999
Vikesh K: At a company level what I know it's more of a if if you're if there's a good amount of biostatistics, or you know people.

384
00:41:55.170 --> 00:41:58.979
Vikesh K: those clinical trials. You need a good amount of stats there.

385
00:41:59.250 --> 00:42:00.190
Vikesh K: Yes.

386
00:42:00.340 --> 00:42:07.810
Vikesh K: So I've come across Cvs where people used to work in as a statistician or Biostatistician in a Pharma company.

387
00:42:07.850 --> 00:42:16.220
Vikesh K: So these are the but but aiml specifically, I don't have, I think, traditionally traditional companies don't still have a lot of openings, I believe.

388
00:42:16.280 --> 00:42:21.190
Vikesh K: But the new, this companies, like, you know, working on genomics who are working

389
00:42:21.270 --> 00:42:34.700
Vikesh K: on something really cool on the at a DNA level, they might use a lot of aim, for example, what Deepmind did right? They figured out the protein structures, and that's what they used deep learning, or, you know, to figure out the protein structure.

390
00:42:34.930 --> 00:42:37.650
Vikesh K: but those are niche companies. I believe.

391
00:42:38.880 --> 00:42:43.309
Preeti Dubey: Okay, yeah. But there is a lot of using of AI right now in.

392
00:42:43.310 --> 00:42:52.660
Vikesh K: Yeah, definitely. Yeah, I just that again, limited domain. And this is a very, you know, very specialized domain where you need to understand pharma healthcare.

393
00:42:52.840 --> 00:42:53.430
Preeti Dubey: Yes.

394
00:42:53.430 --> 00:42:57.930
Vikesh K: Really well, so I have no clue on that other than this generic information. Sorry.

395
00:42:57.930 --> 00:42:59.039
Preeti Dubey: No, thank you.

396
00:42:59.570 --> 00:43:16.329
Vikesh K: But I think one advantage we have, at least in tech is, you know, you can do a lot of experiments, because at the end of the day. You're not making a decision on which life is based. But in Pharma things are a little serious, so you can't really do experiments as you wish.

397
00:43:16.470 --> 00:43:24.529
Vikesh K: Here, 1 1 good thing which I like about tech is, you know you think about, hey? You know, we're changing this message or changing the website design may

398
00:43:24.550 --> 00:43:30.899
Vikesh K: improve how your customer is responding to you, and you can go and you easily launch the experiment.

399
00:43:31.050 --> 00:43:33.270
Vikesh K: I don't think Pharma Year that's allowed. So

400
00:43:33.500 --> 00:43:39.890
Vikesh K: this is, I wouldn't. I would find it very tough to work in Pharma. It's a very difficult role. By the way, that's what I.

401
00:43:39.890 --> 00:43:54.670
Preeti Dubey: Yeah, it's nowadays they are using midd, that is called model informed drug development. So before going to human or animals, they are trying to use AI to drug to drug development.

402
00:43:54.670 --> 00:43:56.910
Vikesh K: Oh, lovely! Okay, that's that's cool.

403
00:43:56.910 --> 00:44:02.920
Preeti Dubey: It's all now. It is approved, I think, in 2016, very recently.

404
00:44:02.920 --> 00:44:03.990
Vikesh K: Okay. Okay.

405
00:44:04.820 --> 00:44:10.800
Vikesh K: See, this is this is what I'm talking about, domain knowledge. I have no clue about this thing. I I did not hear this thing. So

406
00:44:10.920 --> 00:44:15.670
Vikesh K: so that that's where you will shine right if there is a farmer role and all

407
00:44:16.880 --> 00:44:24.809
Vikesh K: okay, others who are silent, or any questions or doubts, or if you have anything about the course per se. Any questions around the course.

408
00:44:29.730 --> 00:44:30.890
Ravi Duvvuri: I know.

409
00:44:30.910 --> 00:44:35.520
Ravi Duvvuri: No, not the course the assignment so my understanding is

410
00:44:36.050 --> 00:44:45.319
Ravi Duvvuri: we will be using anything after the 1st assignment. Got covered right, especially the regression Pca polynomal

411
00:44:45.570 --> 00:44:49.800
Ravi Duvvuri: stats models. Those are the things we should be using to do the

412
00:44:49.990 --> 00:44:51.139
Ravi Duvvuri: assignment correct.

413
00:44:51.140 --> 00:44:54.360
Vikesh K: Yes, yes, that's that's the expectation. Yeah.

414
00:44:55.490 --> 00:45:09.840
Vikesh K: Previously, many people what they have done because they had exposure to, let's say, Decision tree, Random Forest. They also use decision tree, Random forest to solve this assignment. But that's up to you. We don't really expect you to know those things right now.

415
00:45:09.950 --> 00:45:17.619
Vikesh K: and even if you don't use it, that's fine, maybe you can just stick to your regression and other topics, lasso and ridge.

416
00:45:17.970 --> 00:45:19.339
Vikesh K: That should be good enough.

417
00:45:20.370 --> 00:45:20.950
Ravi Duvvuri: Thank you.

418
00:45:21.950 --> 00:45:22.480
Vikesh K: Yeah.

419
00:45:23.390 --> 00:45:26.679
Vikesh K: okay. Any other questions or doubts.

420
00:45:27.200 --> 00:45:30.049
shashi: I had one question on the data dish.

421
00:45:30.790 --> 00:45:34.489
shashi: the project, what the assignment, what we are working on.

422
00:45:34.730 --> 00:45:41.210
shashi: some of the items like cylinders and all they're missing. Nearly 50% of the values are missing.

423
00:45:41.350 --> 00:45:45.530
shashi: So pro. Probably I can ignore those for any of the

424
00:45:45.790 --> 00:45:48.489
shashi: what do you call feature for

425
00:45:48.900 --> 00:45:53.649
shashi: training the model right? I mean, if I'm losing 50% of the information on

426
00:45:53.930 --> 00:45:55.440
shashi: some of this

427
00:45:55.750 --> 00:46:02.910
shashi: fields, I don't have to use them for so, I think, because it will be just if, even if I impute certain values, it will all be

428
00:46:04.820 --> 00:46:13.040
shashi: fake values which I would have by random this one I would have given so probably I I don't want to use that. So that should be fine. I think right.

429
00:46:13.040 --> 00:46:22.730
Vikesh K: Yeah, no, that should be fine, although I would say, just because you know, the best way to learn in machine learning is doing some experimentation. Right? So I would say, maybe use Knn, imputer.

430
00:46:23.580 --> 00:46:25.020
Vikesh K: fill those values.

431
00:46:25.400 --> 00:46:29.739
Vikesh K: and then see if your model gives you a you know the accuracy jumps up.

432
00:46:30.600 --> 00:46:55.640
Vikesh K: That could be one way to, because because yes, either you drop the whole thing, which is but but cylinder might give you some interesting info or important information. So the other, once you've built your basic model, I would always say, start with the basic model. Whatever data. It's too complicated. Right now. Just chuck it, you know. Let's say you have 5 clean columns. Make a model with 5 clean columns, make a baseline, see how it works.

433
00:46:55.640 --> 00:47:06.800
Vikesh K: and then, as a part of next step. So you record your observation. Okay? I got. Let's say, this is a regression problem. Right? All of your doing. Yeah. So let's say yes. So you let's say you go.

434
00:47:07.630 --> 00:47:20.050
Vikesh K: you you got a Rmc value of let's say 100. Okay? Then you next step is you impute the missing values. And then, you see, can you reduce that root mean square value from 100 to 80? Is that possible?

435
00:47:20.530 --> 00:47:22.880
Vikesh K: And a couple of other things? So that would be useful.

436
00:47:23.740 --> 00:47:26.430
Vikesh K: Yeah. I think.

437
00:47:26.430 --> 00:47:27.759
shashi: So once I could

438
00:47:27.850 --> 00:47:28.320
shashi: like

439
00:47:29.450 --> 00:47:35.970
shashi: some there were some 120,000 columns missing for condition, whether it was new or whatever

440
00:47:36.340 --> 00:47:37.050
shashi: so

441
00:47:37.420 --> 00:47:45.659
shashi: and like just counting the number of unique, this one, whatever was missing, I apportioned in the same proportion. I apportioned it.

442
00:47:45.770 --> 00:47:49.549
shashi: and then made it non-normal, so that

443
00:47:49.820 --> 00:47:51.540
shashi: the condition

444
00:47:51.940 --> 00:47:58.089
shashi: I'll have the same bias to all the vehicles in the same ratio. So that kind of logic I used, and I

445
00:47:58.300 --> 00:48:23.280
shashi: need that. So at least one column. I could use it, because condition is one of the detrimental factors when I'm purchasing a used car. So whether it is a new or because cylinder. It is not such an important factor for me to decide whether it has got 4 cylinders and gives me 5 miles per gallon, and if it has got 8 cylinders and gives me 12 miles per gallon, I would rather choose that one, so cylinder may not be important, so

446
00:48:23.430 --> 00:48:35.430
shashi: probably the condition of the vehicle year make. Those are the deciding factors. So I'm trying to clean up those 5 6 columns which are detrimental for determining a used car price

447
00:48:35.450 --> 00:48:40.924
shashi: which normal people will use it. I mean, win missing win number or

448
00:48:41.724 --> 00:48:49.555
shashi: size of our paint, color and all probably may not make much of a difference. So that is what I am assuming for this one. And the last 2 days I've been

449
00:48:49.820 --> 00:49:06.440
shashi: mentally doing and cleaning slowly the data and building a full data, I think, from 426. Now it has come to 337,000. So I've dropped so many of the outliers, and some of them had put 999 million dollars as the rise of a car and things like.

450
00:49:06.650 --> 00:49:09.830
shashi: So all those cleaning up, I have done so I have to start

451
00:49:10.240 --> 00:49:17.279
shashi: documenting it for the final submission, and then build the model, and then again, do that. So that's what I've been thinking.

452
00:49:18.020 --> 00:49:28.740
Vikesh K: 1 1 interesting thing you said, which maybe can be helpful for others. Let's say yes. If your cylinder data is missing. And, for example. You see, there's a good proximation correlation with the mileage.

453
00:49:28.980 --> 00:49:35.260
Vikesh K: Then maybe you don't even need that cylinder information right? Your mileage information can act as a proxy, because

454
00:49:35.612 --> 00:49:42.419
Vikesh K: usually the case is the more cylinders you have. The the car is much more powerful, I believe. Suv car. But then the mileage decreases.

455
00:49:42.682 --> 00:49:43.469
shashi: Is coming. Okay.

456
00:49:43.470 --> 00:49:49.830
Vikesh K: Yes, so they would have an inverse relationship. So in a way, it's a proxy information in mileage about cylinders.

457
00:49:49.930 --> 00:49:57.319
Vikesh K: So there's a there. I'm pretty sure there might be some good correlation there, so that and linear regression. In any case, the assumption is.

458
00:49:57.560 --> 00:50:06.369
Vikesh K: if you have multi collinarity, it might not give you the best output. So so that's that. Then you may not even you don't even have to do that.

459
00:50:07.330 --> 00:50:09.540
Vikesh K: The imputation you don't have to go through that

460
00:50:09.980 --> 00:50:17.669
Vikesh K: for others as well. Please keep this in mind. Please like, look into, especially when you're doing linear regression. Please look into the correlations and everything

461
00:50:17.830 --> 00:50:26.257
Vikesh K: and and see what makes sense. You would do Pca. To do check collinearity. Yes, you can do that your 1st of all. Maybe you see.

462
00:50:28.150 --> 00:50:29.980
Vikesh K: if you can reduce it.

463
00:50:30.560 --> 00:50:38.849
Vikesh K: And you know, let's say to couple of components. And then you see, maybe in terms of prediction, how good or bad your predictions are.

464
00:50:40.190 --> 00:50:43.270
Vikesh K: that's that's 1 thing, Matt, you can try. Yeah, that's a good point.

465
00:50:45.230 --> 00:50:48.129
Vikesh K: But usually the basic, very basic check

466
00:50:48.510 --> 00:50:51.319
Vikesh K: which we do for correlation is called

467
00:50:51.350 --> 00:50:58.749
Vikesh K: Vif test. This is what you use. And I think the Vif value. If it's more than 5,

468
00:50:59.020 --> 00:51:03.600
Vikesh K: it's too high a correlation for the linear regression model.

469
00:51:04.210 --> 00:51:04.920
Vikesh K: Okay.

470
00:51:05.800 --> 00:51:09.670
Vikesh K: that's a more. At least, the house statisticians approach it.

471
00:51:13.180 --> 00:51:20.370
Vikesh K: Cylinders to float. Yes, I think. I, I need to look at the data again just to you know. Remember it correctly.

472
00:51:20.870 --> 00:51:25.720
Vikesh K: but I believe yes, cylinders would be float data correct.

473
00:51:27.510 --> 00:51:28.678
shashi: Here where there is.

474
00:51:29.740 --> 00:51:35.390
shashi: in the data, what we have, it's a 6 cylinder, 4 cylinder. It has been typed. It's a text. So we need to.

475
00:51:35.390 --> 00:51:36.469
Vikesh K: Oh, it's a day. Yeah, yeah.

476
00:51:36.470 --> 00:51:38.319
shashi: We need to do a

477
00:51:38.610 --> 00:51:40.470
shashi: we're not encoding vendor.

478
00:51:41.800 --> 00:51:51.356
Vikesh K: So if it's let's say only 4, 5, 6, you can actually clean it and convert that into a number. Right? You don't even need to do one hot encoding for that, because it's essentially

479
00:51:53.290 --> 00:52:00.180
Vikesh K: the numbers make sense there. It's it's essentially numerical data, right? Because if you have cylinders or 4 cylinders.

480
00:52:00.280 --> 00:52:01.320
Vikesh K: Then you can.

481
00:52:01.320 --> 00:52:08.909
shashi: Inversely correlated to the fuel. There is no mileage here. It's just the kilometer driven.

482
00:52:09.040 --> 00:52:17.590
shashi: So few type of fuel and type of transmission, and there is no mileage. That is the fuel efficiency. So that one is not the

483
00:52:17.910 --> 00:52:24.939
shashi: the what mileage we call in India, and what here the people call mileage is totally opposite.

484
00:52:25.556 --> 00:52:26.450
Vikesh K: Okay, okay.

485
00:52:26.720 --> 00:52:30.460
Vikesh K: I'm also, I'm also opening this data set.

486
00:52:31.140 --> 00:52:33.270
Vikesh K: So that in case someone has any.

487
00:52:36.030 --> 00:52:45.739
Vikesh K: I think, yes, this is a cylinder 1. 0, yes, this you can. Yeah. You can actually clean this like, you can convert this into numbers. Essentially.

488
00:52:47.220 --> 00:52:52.219
Vikesh K: that would be a better approach than maybe you know encoding it.

489
00:52:52.310 --> 00:52:53.610
Vikesh K: not encoding it.

490
00:52:54.400 --> 00:52:59.430
Vikesh K: Okay? And be careful. For example, let's say, if you're using brand

491
00:53:00.786 --> 00:53:07.409
Vikesh K: be careful there, because you need to see how many individual unique categories are there. If you are creating, let's say you end up.

492
00:53:07.410 --> 00:53:08.620
shashi: 9, or something like that.

493
00:53:08.620 --> 00:53:09.060
Vikesh K: Yeah.

494
00:53:09.060 --> 00:53:10.440
shashi: Today is 43.

495
00:53:10.440 --> 00:53:16.470
Vikesh K: Yeah, so this will create 48 new columns, right? So that can be quite messy too much of information there.

496
00:53:16.600 --> 00:53:18.139
Vikesh K: So you have to be careful there

497
00:53:20.530 --> 00:53:22.570
Vikesh K: autometers, mileage.

498
00:53:24.470 --> 00:53:25.930
shashi: That is the

499
00:53:26.000 --> 00:53:27.090
shashi: other column.

500
00:53:27.340 --> 00:53:31.549
shashi: The drive is the sorry, not the drive. It is. The odometer is the

501
00:53:31.630 --> 00:53:33.140
shashi: what the current reading.

502
00:53:34.210 --> 00:53:34.730
Vikesh K: Yeah.

503
00:53:34.730 --> 00:53:36.279
shashi: There are some very

504
00:53:36.650 --> 00:53:39.199
shashi: crazy outliers on that. So

505
00:53:39.270 --> 00:53:40.739
shashi: so all those had to go.

506
00:53:42.660 --> 00:53:49.489
Vikesh K: Mac to your code. This is good code, although I what I would also suggest, if you have to write little more

507
00:53:50.040 --> 00:53:57.740
Vikesh K: concisely. You will see the pattern is number space cylinder. So actually, you can put that as a.

508
00:53:57.740 --> 00:53:58.160
shashi: Correct. Yeah.

509
00:53:58.160 --> 00:54:03.490
Vikesh K: Numbers like a space cylinders, and replace all of that with blank.

510
00:54:03.610 --> 00:54:08.920
Vikesh K: So you will just get the number. So you don't have to individually. Write it cylinder by cylinder.

511
00:54:09.040 --> 00:54:13.259
Vikesh K: and then, for whatever is other, you make it missing you. You

512
00:54:13.270 --> 00:54:14.960
Vikesh K: put it. Na, that's correct.

513
00:54:15.370 --> 00:54:17.570
Vikesh K: but you can actually put a pattern there.

514
00:54:20.450 --> 00:54:21.970
shashi: 0 cylinders for that.

515
00:54:23.710 --> 00:54:28.440
shashi: but that 0 has a different connotation here, so we can't use 0. There.

516
00:54:29.310 --> 00:54:30.530
Vikesh K: Oh, that's true. Yeah.

517
00:54:31.400 --> 00:54:35.039
Vikesh K: do. Are the columns only this much or.

518
00:54:35.040 --> 00:54:36.989
shashi: Yeah, these are the meeting columns.

519
00:54:36.990 --> 00:54:39.050
Vikesh K: Okay, okay, 18 columns correct?

520
00:54:39.890 --> 00:54:45.960
Vikesh K: Because, they sometimes keep changing. Sometimes they update. And also I just wanted to be sure, okay.

521
00:54:47.670 --> 00:55:02.230
Vikesh K: so you have region price. It's a it's a good problem. It's a painful problem. But remember, that's how most of the real live data set is. It's quite messy. And you 1st need to focus on the messy part. Bring it to shape before you can start working on it.

522
00:55:02.550 --> 00:55:06.198
Vikesh K: Yeah. So that's that's where most of the learning would be

523
00:55:07.440 --> 00:55:08.989
Vikesh K: and then go home as well.

524
00:55:12.042 --> 00:55:16.269
Vikesh K: Matt, yes, for the timing. Yes, that could be a good approach.

525
00:55:18.070 --> 00:55:27.869
Vikesh K: You start with that. And that's why I start with the basics make a good baseline model see what the output looks like. And then in the next part, you know you keep iterating it.

526
00:55:27.920 --> 00:55:30.719
Vikesh K: Don't try to do everything in one. Go maybe have

527
00:55:30.750 --> 00:55:45.380
Vikesh K: multiple runs at it, multiple goals at it. That will. That also would be good for learning. You know. What is that? Sometimes what happens? For example, in. And this is very important from a business context. Let's say, I'm presenting to a management

528
00:55:46.150 --> 00:55:58.719
Vikesh K: I have got 90% accuracy. Okay. But to go from, and maybe that 90% accuracy wasn't very difficult to achieve. But to go from 90% accuracy. To, let's say, 95% accuracy. I have to really boil the ocean.

529
00:55:59.120 --> 00:56:07.950
Vikesh K: That might take 2 weeks additional 3 weeks additional. So if the business, if the your machine learning model, the output is not very critical.

530
00:56:08.310 --> 00:56:13.449
Vikesh K: okay? Or it's it's just one of the steps in business decision making.

531
00:56:13.470 --> 00:56:14.599
Vikesh K: Then it's fine.

532
00:56:14.790 --> 00:56:18.520
Vikesh K: You don't really have to boil the ocean to go from 90% accuracy

533
00:56:18.600 --> 00:56:25.180
Vikesh K: to 95% accuracy. Okay? Because it might take you 3 more weeks or one more month to do.

534
00:56:25.290 --> 00:56:31.519
Vikesh K: and business is not able to take decision during that time. You know your let's say your director. Your Vp is not able to take decision that time.

535
00:56:31.690 --> 00:56:33.989
Vikesh K: So sometimes it does, it's not worth it.

536
00:56:34.770 --> 00:56:51.510
Vikesh K: Okay, just be. This is, I'm telling more of a practitioner perspective like this is becomes some philosophical question. Obviously, when when we do a course, you're taught to get as much accuracy as possible. But often in business. It's not easy, because, remember, here, the data set is ready for you

537
00:56:51.690 --> 00:57:01.869
Vikesh K: there in real life, to get from 90% accuracy, for example, to get 96% accuracy. You need some additional data sets or columns which you don't have available easily

538
00:57:01.970 --> 00:57:08.169
Vikesh K: and sometimes in big companies, it can be challenging to get the relevant data at the right level. So

539
00:57:08.290 --> 00:57:09.760
Vikesh K: be careful about that.

540
00:57:09.820 --> 00:57:21.709
Vikesh K: That's why I say, you 1st make a baseline model. See what's the output, what the output you got? What is the Rmsc. You got? And then, you know, and also please document it just for your own learning. You know how you improved it.

541
00:57:21.780 --> 00:57:29.870
Vikesh K: because this is the same approach you will take with your capstone. There's nothing different. Only thing which will change is the data set, but the approach

542
00:57:30.330 --> 00:57:31.460
Vikesh K: will be the same.

543
00:57:31.740 --> 00:57:32.490
Vikesh K: Okay.

544
00:57:37.030 --> 00:57:48.829
Vikesh K: okay, we also have reached towards the end. So if you have any other questions, please let me know. I will just look at the other question, Matt, does it make sense to have correlation with price and one column, for instance, there are too many manufacture.

545
00:57:49.190 --> 00:57:51.470
Vikesh K: but a single coefficient is doable.

546
00:57:53.830 --> 00:58:02.039
Vikesh K: I I didn't understand that exactly, Matt. So you want to. You want to drop the manufacturer column, or do you want to like use just one.

547
00:58:02.220 --> 00:58:05.479
Vikesh K: I'm not really sure if I understood that correctly.

548
00:58:08.860 --> 00:58:12.240
Vikesh K: you want to isolate manner. So so what I would say

549
00:58:12.430 --> 00:58:16.979
Vikesh K: maybe right now, just drop the manufacturing column. Don't use it in your model.

550
00:58:17.350 --> 00:58:25.109
Vikesh K: and then then you may be. By the way, where you can't do one hot encoding you. You can do other kinds of encoding there.

551
00:58:25.270 --> 00:58:34.730
Vikesh K: So maybe research about it a bit. But there, there are also other encoding techniques. For example, there's something called, I think it's called ordinal encoding

552
00:58:35.350 --> 00:58:40.209
Vikesh K: some. The names can be confusing sometimes, but look for other encoding techniques

553
00:58:40.780 --> 00:58:42.549
Vikesh K: which can be helpful when you have

554
00:58:43.130 --> 00:58:44.719
Vikesh K: too much cardinality.

555
00:58:45.580 --> 00:58:48.280
Vikesh K: Okay? And that that can be another approach.

556
00:58:53.530 --> 00:59:04.540
Vikesh K: But I'm I'm happy. You're actually moving very fast on this. You and Shashi. I've already. I think it's. It's only since one or 2 days this module has been launched. You guys have already made a lot of progress.

557
00:59:05.150 --> 00:59:06.140
Vikesh K: but that's cool.

558
00:59:06.820 --> 00:59:07.350
Vikesh K: So other.

559
00:59:07.350 --> 00:59:23.970
shashi: I have to finish before Monday. I'm trying to finish it before Monday, because Monday and Tuesday I have doctor appointment, and it takes me literally half 2, half days to go and come back, and so I don't want last minute treasure for some patients.

560
00:59:23.970 --> 00:59:25.079
Vikesh K: Sure makes sense.

561
00:59:25.170 --> 00:59:26.870
Vikesh K: Okay, okay, cool.

562
00:59:29.730 --> 00:59:31.829
Vikesh K: Oh, last time it took you 2 weeks

563
00:59:32.304 --> 00:59:40.250
Vikesh K: no, I can understand. Matt. But that's the fun that that's the main thing in them. You know, when you're doing some practical assignments.

564
00:59:40.320 --> 00:59:46.200
Vikesh K: That's where most of the learning happens when you bang your head against the wall because it can become little challenging.

565
00:59:46.600 --> 00:59:48.629
Vikesh K: That's where the main learning happens.

566
00:59:48.900 --> 00:59:54.394
shashi: And that's when the best output also comes. I think you know, when last is on fire. Everything

567
00:59:54.700 --> 00:59:55.869
Vikesh K: That comes up.

568
00:59:56.720 --> 01:00:08.359
shashi: And I did the last assignment I mean, I worked, I think, 26 h straight. I didn't even yawn once. I mean all the food was coming to the table. I sat in front of the computer and finished it in one day.

569
01:00:08.360 --> 01:00:09.250
Vikesh K: Oh, wow!

570
01:00:09.480 --> 01:00:10.590
Vikesh K: Oh, lovely!

571
01:00:11.390 --> 01:00:14.149
Vikesh K: But but I won't advise that for long run.

572
01:00:14.150 --> 01:00:17.055
shashi: I know it's not a sustainable model.

573
01:00:17.470 --> 01:00:17.820
Vikesh K: That's true.

574
01:00:18.445 --> 01:00:19.070
shashi: Yeah.

575
01:00:19.650 --> 01:00:22.180
shashi: cool. It took me 3 days to recover from that.

576
01:00:22.618 --> 01:00:24.810
Vikesh K: Okay, no, I can imagine.

577
01:00:24.960 --> 01:00:26.480
Vikesh K: Now that happens.

578
01:00:27.230 --> 01:00:29.139
Vikesh K: Others who have been very silent.

579
01:00:29.460 --> 01:00:31.490
Vikesh K: Mike Shika

580
01:00:32.880 --> 01:00:37.980
Vikesh K: iphone 13 pro max. Any questions or doubts before we call it a day.

581
01:00:39.940 --> 01:00:42.585
Vikesh K: I hope the course is going well at your end.

582
01:00:46.040 --> 01:00:50.959
Vikesh K: like I as a holiday period is coming. I know there might be some temptation to.

583
01:00:51.502 --> 01:00:54.410
Vikesh K: you know. Take it a little lightly, but just hang in there.

584
01:00:54.970 --> 01:01:00.609
Vikesh K: because now now the course will also becoming more interesting, right? So just hang it! There.

585
01:01:00.610 --> 01:01:03.210
shashi: I had one more question

586
01:01:03.260 --> 01:01:08.220
shashi: on time series this one. There are so many materials available, but

587
01:01:08.230 --> 01:01:18.879
shashi: some of them are pretty confusing. Are there any good this one? Or should I explore any additional courses for times? Because it's a very, very interesting topic, and

588
01:01:19.713 --> 01:01:20.840
shashi: looks very.

589
01:01:21.550 --> 01:01:30.010
shashi: It's in English. It sounds very easy, but mathematically it is so involved, and it takes a lot of understanding and deep involvement in that.

590
01:01:30.590 --> 01:01:36.719
Vikesh K: Yeah, I would say, one of the one of the good guys who who does a pretty good job in time series called Rob Hinman.

591
01:01:36.890 --> 01:01:47.100
Vikesh K: but he has. He has a very good book, but that book is in R, so that that can be one challenging, although there are many people who have put up a github, a python version on Github.

592
01:01:47.310 --> 01:01:54.330
Vikesh K: So like the same R code, they have already translated it, and also you can use Chat Gpt, now, you know, to take the help.

593
01:01:54.550 --> 01:02:01.440
Vikesh K: But Rob Hindman does a very good job. He's considered as sort of a guru in this time series. Space

594
01:02:02.535 --> 01:02:05.869
Vikesh K: there's 1 more Lady Gallet, shumely.

595
01:02:09.000 --> 01:02:11.308
Vikesh K: I I forgot her galit.

596
01:02:11.850 --> 01:02:12.860
Vikesh K: yes.

597
01:02:13.390 --> 01:02:14.590
Vikesh K: so

598
01:02:14.720 --> 01:02:21.080
Vikesh K: she teaches in Taiwan. She's also focuses on time series, so she can be a good teacher.

599
01:02:21.480 --> 01:02:31.580
Vikesh K: She has written one or 2 books. I believe one of them is in Python. Maybe if I get that correctly, but both both of them usually are. R, based.

600
01:02:33.000 --> 01:02:33.920
Vikesh K: Yeah. But

601
01:02:34.420 --> 01:02:35.879
Vikesh K: there might be some.

602
01:02:35.990 --> 01:02:38.839
Vikesh K: I don't remember any good python book for stats.

603
01:02:39.230 --> 01:02:40.190
Vikesh K: as of now.

604
01:02:41.580 --> 01:02:43.359
Vikesh K: It will. Yeah, it will update.

605
01:02:43.920 --> 01:02:44.640
Vikesh K: Yeah.

606
01:02:45.850 --> 01:03:00.969
Vikesh K: cool. If there are no more questions we can call it a day. Thank you for your time. I hope this was helpful. This was informal session more unstructured. But I hope this was a good use of your time. No, Mac, don't learn. Our python is fine. Yeah.

607
01:03:01.230 --> 01:03:10.100
Vikesh K: don't kill yourself. Yeah, this is python is fine. Python is in any case becoming quite popular all over the place, so

608
01:03:11.310 --> 01:03:16.759
Vikesh K: I would say, rather, go deep in Python and and and the applications of Python.

609
01:03:17.800 --> 01:03:24.229
shashi: Also, I think pytorch is has more traction than tensorflow. If I'm not mistaken, right? Yeah.

610
01:03:24.230 --> 01:03:24.650
Vikesh K: Yes, yes.

611
01:03:24.650 --> 01:03:36.039
shashi: So that's what once I build these models during I mean, or just after the course I want to redo all these things in using pytorch also, so that way it can

612
01:03:36.250 --> 01:03:36.840
shashi: use of.

613
01:03:37.179 --> 01:03:44.639
Vikesh K: Although the new tire tensorflow, the the in terms of syntax and in terms of approach, is not dramatically different from pytorch.

614
01:03:44.640 --> 01:03:45.300
shashi: Yeah.

615
01:03:45.300 --> 01:03:49.480
Vikesh K: But Pytorch, it has sort of taken a lead now over tensor.

616
01:03:50.070 --> 01:03:51.080
Vikesh K: So that's true.

617
01:03:51.410 --> 01:03:56.100
Vikesh K: So by. But but having said that, we in this course, we focus on tensorflow.

618
01:03:56.100 --> 01:03:56.670
shashi: Sfty, yeah.

619
01:03:56.670 --> 01:04:01.540
Vikesh K: But it's not a big jump moving from the concepts. Remain the same.

620
01:04:02.160 --> 01:04:02.970
Vikesh K: Yeah.

621
01:04:03.310 --> 01:04:10.239
Vikesh K: yeah, cool. Thank you, then, and we'll meet you next week. Then, right where we talk about practical assignment

622
01:04:10.530 --> 01:04:13.230
Vikesh K: cheers bye, everyone, bye.

623
01:04:13.860 --> 01:04:14.810
shashi: Bye, everybody!
