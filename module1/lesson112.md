# Mini-Lesson 1.2: Calculating Expected Value and Variance

## Introduction
The mode, a statistical measure of central tendency, identifies the value that occurs most frequently within a dataset. In situations where the dataset exhibits symmetry and possesses a single mode, this mode aligns with the mean (expected value), providing an insight into the central point of the distribution.

## Relationship to Variance
Distinguishing itself from the mean and median, the mode does not contribute to the calculation of variance, a metric that gauges the extent of dispersion in a dataset. Nevertheless, the mode can be instrumental in discerning the distribution's shape. Notably, a unimodal distribution with a distinct peak, where values gravitate around the mode, tends to exhibit lower variance compared to distributions with multiple modes or flatter profiles.

## Summary
While the mode does not directly impact the computation of expected value and variance, it serves as a valuable indicator of central tendency and distribution shape. A comprehensive understanding of a dataset necessitates consideration of multiple statistical measures.

## Example
Suppose we have a dataset with the grades of 15 students for a test.

| Student # | Grade |
|-----------|-------|
| 1         | 15    |
| 2         | 16    |
| 3         | 17    |
| 4         | 18    |
| 5         | 19    |
| 6         | 18    |
| 7         | 17    |
| 8         | 18    |
| 9         | 18    |
| 10        | 18    |
| 11        | 20    |
| 12        | 18    |
| 13        | 17    |
| 14        | 15    |
| 15        | 16    |

### Results
- Mode = 18
- Mean = 17.3
- Median = 17.5
