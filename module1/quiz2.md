# Probability and Statistical Modeling Quiz

## Question 1 (1 point)
How would you describe a system that, when given the same input, provides a different output each time it is sampled?

**Options:**
1. Problematic system
2. Deterministic system
3. Non-deterministic system
4. Probabilistic system

**Answer:** Non-deterministic system

*Explanation:* A non-deterministic system is one that can produce different outputs for the same input on different runs. This is fundamentally different from a deterministic system, which always produces the same output for a given input. While such systems can also be described as probabilistic, the core definition emphasizes their non-deterministic nature.

## Question 2 (1 point)
What is the name for the type of output that occurs when a coin is tossed and can result in either heads or tails?

**Options:**
1. Continuous distribution
2. Wide-spread distribution
3. Discrete distribution
4. Predictable distribution

**Answer:** Discrete distribution

*Explanation:* A discrete distribution describes outcomes that take on distinct, separate values (like heads or tails) with no possible values in between. A coin toss is a classic example of a discrete probability distribution with exactly two possible outcomes.

## Question 3 (1 point)
How is the expression Y~Fy interpreted in statistical modeling?

**Options:**
1. Y is equivalent to Fy
2. Y is not related to Fy
3. Y is greater than Fy
4. Y is a function of Fy

**Answer:** Y is a function of Fy

*Explanation:* In statistical notation, Y~Fy indicates that the random variable Y follows (or is distributed according to) the probability distribution Fy. This means Y is a function of the distribution Fy, representing the relationship between the variable and its underlying probability distribution.

## Question 4 (1 point)
What is the size of the output of the formula [y]12?

**Options:**
1. 13
2. 12
3. 3
4. 11

**Answer:** 12

*Explanation:* In this statistical notation, [y]12 indicates a set with 12 unique outputs. The subscript number (12) specifies the number of distinct values in the output set. Therefore, the size of the output is exactly 12.
