# Module 1 Quiz

## Question 1 (1 point)
Which statement accurately describes the relationship between task complexity and the model's complexity?

**Options:**
1. As task complexity increases, the more complicated the model needs to be to represent it.
2. As task complexity increases, the less computational power is needed to process the data.
3. As task complexity decreases, the less data are needed to train the model.
4. As task complexity increases, the less computational power is needed to process the data.

**Answer:** 1 - As task complexity increases, the more complicated the model needs to be to represent it.

*Explanation:* This is a fundamental principle in machine learning. More complex tasks (like recognizing objects in images) require more sophisticated models with more parameters and layers compared to simpler tasks (like linear regression). This increased complexity is needed to capture and represent the intricate patterns and relationships in complex data.

## Question 2 (1 point)
Which of the following is used in Python to represent a list of numbers?

**Options:**
1. Array
2. Date
3. String
4. DataFrame

**Answer:** 1 - Array

*Explanation:* In Python, numerical lists are typically represented as arrays, specifically using NumPy arrays or Python lists. Arrays are the fundamental data structure for storing and manipulating sequences of numbers efficiently. While DataFrames (from pandas) can store numbers, they are more suited for structured, tabular data with multiple columns.

## Question 3 (1 point)
Which of the following loss functions is used to measure the difference between predicted and actual output values of y in regression problems?

**Options:**
1. Squared error
2. Accuracy
3. Huber loss
4. F1 score

**Answer:** 1 - Squared error

*Explanation:* Squared error (also known as Mean Squared Error when averaged) is a fundamental loss function for regression problems. It measures the average squared difference between predicted and actual values, making it ideal for continuous output variables. Accuracy and F1 score are for classification tasks, while Huber loss is a robust alternative to squared error but not as commonly used as the primary definition.
