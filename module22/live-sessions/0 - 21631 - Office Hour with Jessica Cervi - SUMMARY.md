### Implementation Example
```python
# Basic setup
import openai
client = openai.OpenAI(api_key='your-api-key')

# Text generation example
response = client.chat.completions.create(
    model="gpt-3.5-turbo",
    messages=[{"role": "user", "content": "Write a story..."}]
)

# Image generation example
response = client.images.generate(
    model="dall-e-2",
    prompt="your-prompt",
    size="512x512",
    n=1
)
```
