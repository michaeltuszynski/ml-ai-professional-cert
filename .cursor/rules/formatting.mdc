# Cursor to Notion Markdown Compatibility Rules

## Basic Text Formatting

1. Headers:
   - Use ATX-style headers (`#`) instead of Setext-style (`===` or `---`)
   - Always include a space after the `#` symbols
   - Leave one blank line before and after headers
   ```markdown
   # Header 1

   ## Header 2
   ```

2. Emphasis:
   - Use asterisks (`*`) consistently instead of underscores (`_`)
   - Single asterisk for italics: `*italic*`
   - Double asterisk for bold: `**bold**` (no spaces between asterisks and text)
   - Triple asterisk for bold-italic: `***bold-italic***`
   - For section headings or terms: `**Term**: Definition`
   - For inline emphasis: `This sentence has **important words** in the middle`

3. Lists:
   - Use hyphens (`-`) for unordered lists instead of asterisks or plus signs
   - Always include exactly one space after the hyphen: `- Item` (not `-Item`)
   - Use proper indentation (2 spaces) for each nesting level
   - **Always include blank line before first bullet and after last bullet**
   - No blank lines between bullets in the same list
   ```markdown
   - First level
     - Second level
     - Another second
   - Back to first
   ```

## Code Blocks

1. Fenced Code Blocks:
   - Use triple backticks (```) instead of indentation
   - Always specify the language after the opening backticks
   - Include a blank line before and after code blocks
   ```markdown
   ```python
   def example():
       return True
   ```
   ```

2. Inline Code:
   - Use single backticks (`)
   - Don't use spaces between the backticks and the code
   - Example: `code`

3. Code Blocks in Lists:
   - Indent code blocks with 4 spaces more than the bullet level
   - Include blank line before and after code block
   - Example:
   ```markdown
   - Bullet point

       ```python
       def example():
           return True
       ```

   - Next bullet point
   ```

## Combined Formatting

1. Bold with Bullets:
   - Place bold formatting completely inside the bullet text
   - Complete bold bullet: `- **Entire bullet in bold**`
   - Partial bold bullet: `- Regular text with **bold text** in middle`
   - Avoid starting with bold then breaking: `- **Bold** Non-bold` (use `- **Bold Non-bold**` instead)
   - **IMPORTANT**: When a bullet starts with bold text followed by a description, use a hyphen instead of a colon:
     - CORRECT: `- **Term** - Description`
     - INCORRECT: `- **Term**: Description` (may show raw markdown in Notion)
   - This applies to both main bullets and sub-bullets

2. Other Combinations:
   - Bullets with links: `- [Link text](mdc:https:/example.com)`
   - Bullets with inline code: `- Text with `code` inside`
   - Bullets with emphasis: `- Text with *italics* inside`

## Links and Images

1. Links:
   - Use reference-style links for better readability
   - Keep references at the bottom of the document
   ```markdown
   [Link text][reference]

   [reference]: https://example.com
   ```

2. Images:
   - Use the exclamation mark syntax
   - Include alt text in brackets
   - Store images in a consistent location relative to the markdown file
   ```markdown
   ![Alt text](mdc:images/example.png)
   ```

## Tables

1. Structure:
   - Use standard pipe syntax
   - Include header row separation
   - Align columns using colons in the separator row
   ```markdown
   | Header 1 | Header 2 | Header 3 |
   |:---------|:--------:|---------:|
   | Left     | Center   | Right    |
   ```

## Special Considerations

1. Math Equations:
   - Use double dollar signs for block equations
   - Use single dollar signs for inline equations
   - Leave spaces around inline equation markers
   ```markdown
   This is an inline equation $ E = mc^2 $

   $$
   \frac{d}{dx}(x^n) = nx^{n-1}
   $$
   ```

2. Checkboxes:
   - Use standard GitHub-style syntax
   - Include a space after the brackets
   ```markdown
   - [ ] Unchecked task
   - [x] Checked task
   ```

3. Line Breaks:
   - Use two spaces at the end of lines for soft breaks
   - Use blank lines for paragraph breaks
   - Avoid using backslash line breaks

4. Section Spacing:
   - Always include blank line before and after headers
   - Always include blank line before and after lists
   - Always include blank line before and after code blocks
   - Never place two block elements together without a blank line between them

## Document Structure

1. Frontmatter:
   - Include YAML frontmatter at the start of documents
   - Use triple dashes to denote frontmatter section
   ```markdown
   ---
   title: Document Title
   date: 2025-02-01
   tags: [tag1, tag2]
   ---
   ```

2. Table of Contents:
   - Use heading-based navigation
   - Include a TOC after frontmatter if document is long
   - Use consistent heading levels (no skipping levels)

## Best Practices

1. File Organization:
   - Use lowercase names with hyphens for files
   - Maintain a consistent folder structure
   - Keep related images in an `images/` subdirectory

2. Formatting:
   - Limit line length to 80 characters
   - Use consistent indentation (2 spaces)
   - Include a single blank line at the end of files

3. Special Characters:
   - Escape special characters with backslash
   - Use HTML entities for symbols when needed
   - Be consistent with quote styles (straight quotes preferred)

## Common Issues to Avoid

1. Don't use:
   - HTML tags (except when absolutely necessary)
   - Complex nested structures
   - Inline styles
   - Custom CSS
   - JavaScript

2. Be careful with:
   - Nested blockquotes (limit to one level)
   - Table complexity (keep simple)
   - Image paths (use relative paths)
   - Special characters in headers

## Terminology Sections

1. Formatting Definitions:
   - When creating a list of terms or definitions, use hyphens instead of colons after bold terms
   - CORRECT: `- **Term** - Definition of the term`
   - INCORRECT: `- **Term**: Definition of the term`
   - This prevents Notion from displaying raw Markdown syntax
   - Apply this rule consistently to all terminology or glossary sections
