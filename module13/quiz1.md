# Machine Learning Quiz: Logistic Regression

## Question 1: Model Prediction Requirements
**Q: When using a logistic regression model, if you want to predict the value of a new data point, what do you need?**

### Options:
1. The residuals of the logistic regression model
2. The weights (coefficients) of the logistic regression model
3. The training error from the logistic regression model
4. The entire existing dataset

✅ **Correct Answer:** 2

*Explanation: The weights (coefficients) are all you need to make predictions with a trained logistic regression model.*

## Question 2: Probability Output Models
**Q: Which type of regression model outputs a continuous-valued probability that a data point belongs to a specific class?**

### Options:
1. Logistic regression
2. Linear regression
3. Polynomial regression
4. Ridge regression

✅ **Correct Answer:** 1

*Explanation: Logistic regression outputs probabilities between 0 and 1, representing the likelihood of belonging to a specific class.*

## Question 3: Outlier Sensitivity
**Q: Which of the following statements is true regarding the sensitivity to outliers in linear regression and logistic regression?**

### Options:
1. Linear regression is less sensitive to outliers than logistic regression
2. Neither linear regression nor logistic regression is sensitive to outliers
3. Logistic regression is less sensitive to outliers than linear regression
4. Both linear and logistic regression are equally sensitive to outliers

✅ **Correct Answer:** 3

*Explanation: Logistic regression is less sensitive to outliers because its sigmoid function bounds the output between 0 and 1, while linear regression can be heavily influenced by extreme values.*
