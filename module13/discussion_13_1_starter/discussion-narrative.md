I chose the Bank Marketing dataset contains information about direct marketing campaigns (phone calls) of a Portuguese banking institution. The classification goal is to predict if a client will subscribe to a term deposit.

Features of the data:
- Age: Customer's age
- Job: Type of job (admin, blue-collar, entrepreneur, etc.)
- Marital: Marital status
- Education: Education level
- Default: Has credit in default?
- Balance: Average yearly balance
- Housing: Has housing loan?
- Loan: Has personal loan?
- Contact: Contact communication type
- Campaign: Number of contacts performed
- Previous: Number of contacts before this campaign

The classification problem: Whether the client subscribes to a term deposit

This classification model can help the bank:
1. Optimize marketing resources by targeting likely subscribers
2. Increase campaign ROI by focusing on high-probability prospects
3. Develop personalized marketing strategies based on feature importance
