# MTCars Dataset Analysis

## Fuel Efficiency
- Shows negative correlation with:
  - Number of cylinders
  - Engine displacement
  - Horsepower
  - Weight
- Shows positive correlation with:
  - Rear axle ratio (drat)
  - Quarter mile time (qsec)
- Notable: Straight engines demonstrate higher MPG

## Engine Size and Power
- Strong positive correlations observed between:
  - Number of cylinders
  - Engine displacement
  - Horsepower
- V-shaped engines typically show higher values for these metrics

## Weight Characteristics
- Positive correlation with engine metrics:
  - Number of cylinders
  - Displacement
  - Horsepower
- Negative correlation with:
  - MPG
  - Quarter mile time (qsec)
- V-shaped engine vehicles tend to be heavier

## Performance Metrics
- Quarter mile time (qsec):
  - Negatively correlated with horsepower
  - Positively correlated with MPG
- Straight engine vehicles typically show longer quarter mile times (slower acceleration)

## Transmission and Gearing
- Manual transmission vehicles (am=1):
  - Better fuel efficiency (MPG)
  - Lower overall weight
- Higher gear ratios correlate with:
  - Improved MPG
  - Reduced weight

## Carburetor Configuration
- Positive correlation with:
  - Engine size variables
  - Power metrics
- Negative correlation with:
  - MPG
  - Quarter mile time (qsec)

## Rear Axle Ratio (drat)
- Shows positive correlation with MPG
- Slight negative correlation with:
  - Weight
  - Engine size variables

## Summary
The data reveals clear trade-offs between performance and efficiency. V-engines offer superior power but consume more fuel, while straight engines and manual transmissions tend to favor efficiency over raw performance.
