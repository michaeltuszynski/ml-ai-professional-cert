# Statistics Quiz 5: Correlation and Probability

## Question 1 (1 point)
What is the symbol used to represent correlation measures in a correlation matrix?

**Options:**
1. mu (ùúá)
2. rho (‚ç¥)
3. sigma squared (ùúé¬≤)
4. sigma (ùúé)

**Answer:** Option 2: rho (‚ç¥)
The correlation coefficient is typically represented by the Greek letter rho (‚ç¥) in a correlation matrix. This symbol specifically denotes the population correlation coefficient, while 'r' is commonly used for sample correlation.

## Question 2 (1 point)
What is the equation to get the conditional probability of variable Y given X?

**Options:**
1. Py(Y|X=x)= Py(Y)/Px(X)
2. Py(Y|X=x)= Px(X)/Px(X)
3. Py(Y|X=x)= Px,y(X,Y)/Px(X)
4. Py(Y|X=x)= Px,y(X,Y)

**Answer:** Option 3: Py(Y|X=x)= Px,y(X,Y)/Px(X)
The conditional probability is defined as the joint probability of X and Y divided by the marginal probability of X. This formula represents the probability of Y occurring, given that X has occurred.

## Question 3 (1 point)
If two variables 'X' and 'Y' are independent of each other, then what is the joint distribution PX,Y(X,Y)?

**Options:**
1. PX,Y(X,Y) =PY(Y)
2. PX,Y(X,Y) =PX(X)
3. PX,Y(X,Y) =PX(X)PY(Y)
4. PX,Y(X,Y) =PX(X)/PY(Y)

**Answer:** Option 3: PX,Y(X,Y) =PX(X)PY(Y)
For independent variables, the joint probability distribution is equal to the product of their individual marginal distributions. This is a fundamental property of statistical independence.
