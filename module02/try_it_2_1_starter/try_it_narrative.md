# Baseball Salary Analysis: Sample Size Impact

## Sample Data Results

| Sample Size | Mean of Sample Means | Standard Deviation of Sample Means |
|------------|---------------------|----------------------------------|
| 5          | $2,504,127.07      | $1,576,414.84                   |
| 10         | $2,475,060.87      | $1,129,806.40                   |
| 25         | $2,511,552.57      | $707,040.38                     |
| 50         | $2,504,800.93      | $491,358.87                     |
| 100        | $2,499,244.91      | $330,111.84                     |

## Key Findings

The analysis of baseball salary data reveals several important patterns:

1. **Consistency in Means**: The mean of sample means remains relatively stable, ranging from $2.48M to $2.51M
2. **Decreasing Variability**: Standard deviation shows significant reduction as sample size increases:
   - At n=5: $1.576 million
   - At n=100: $330,112

3. **Distribution Characteristics**:
   - Larger samples demonstrate increasingly normal distribution
   - Precision improves with larger samples, though with diminishing returns

## Practical Implications

1. **Small Sample Caution**: Exercise skepticism with small sample conclusions
2. **Resource Management**: Consider the trade-off between precision needs and resource constraints
3. **Sample Size Importance**: Proper sample sizing is crucial, especially with highly variable data like salaries

## Conclusion

This analysis demonstrates two fundamental statistical principles in action:
- The Law of Large Numbers
- The Central Limit Theorem

These principles reinforce that sample size significantly impacts data reliability and statistical inference quality.
