# Multivariate Statistics Quiz

## Question 1 (1 point)
What do you call the matrix that is used to compute the variances and covariances of a multivariate random variable?

**Options:**
1. Identity matrix
2. Covariance matrix
3. Scalar matrix
4. Zero matrix

**Answer:** Option 2: Covariance matrix

*Explanation:* A covariance matrix is a square matrix that contains the variances and covariances associated with several variables. The diagonal elements represent the variances of the variables, while the off-diagonal elements represent the covariances between pairs of variables.

## Question 2 (1 point)
Which of the following statements about covariance between two random variables X and Y is correct?

**Options:**
1. Covariance measures the extent to which two variables change together
2. Covariance is always positive
3. Covariance is independent of the scales of the variables
4. Covariance is a measure of the spread of the individual variables

**Answer:** Option 1: Covariance measures the extent to which two variables change together

*Explanation:* Covariance is fundamentally a measure of the joint variability between two variables. It indicates whether variables tend to move together (positive covariance), move in opposite directions (negative covariance), or have no linear relationship (zero covariance).

## Question 3 (1 point)
In a correlation matrix of two random variables, X and Y, why are the diagonal elements always 1?

**Options:**
1. Because the correlation matrix is normalized
2. Because the correlation matrix is symmetric
3. Because the correlation between X and Y is always 1
4. Because the correlation between any variable and itself is always 1

**Answer:** Option 4: Because the correlation between any variable and itself is always 1

*Explanation:* The correlation coefficient of a variable with itself is always 1 because it represents perfect positive correlation. This is mathematically proven by the correlation formula: when X=Y, Corr(X,X) = Cov(X,X)/[σx * σx] = Var(X)/Var(X) = 1.
