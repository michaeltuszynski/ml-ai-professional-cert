# Statistics Quiz 2: Sampling Distributions

## Question 1 (1 point)
What does the central limit theorem (CLT) suggest about the sampling distribution of the sample mean for a sufficiently large sample size?

**Options:**
1. It will be uniformly distributed
2. It will be exponentially distributed
3. It will be normally distributed
4. It will be binomially distributed

**Answer:** Option 3: It will be normally distributed

*Explanation:* The Central Limit Theorem (CLT) states that regardless of the underlying population distribution, the sampling distribution of the sample mean will approximate a normal distribution as the sample size becomes sufficiently large. This is a fundamental principle in statistics that enables many statistical inference methods.

## Question 2 (1 point)
A population has a mean of 50 and a standard deviation of 10. If samples of size 100 are repeatedly drawn from this population, according to the central limit theorem (CLT), what is the approximate mean and standard deviation of the sampling distribution of the sample mean?

**Options:**
1. Mean = 50, Standard deviation = 10
2. Mean = 50, Standard deviation = 0.1
3. Mean = 50, Standard deviation = 0.01
4. Mean = 50, Standard deviation = 1

**Answer:** Option 4: Mean = 50, Standard deviation = 1

*Explanation:* According to the CLT:
- The mean of the sampling distribution equals the population mean (μ = 50)
- The standard deviation of the sampling distribution (standard error) equals the population standard deviation divided by the square root of the sample size: σ/√n = 10/√100 = 10/10 = 1

## Question 3 (1 point)
What is the general threshold decided by statisticians for random variable sample size?

**Options:**
1. 30
2. 10
3. 40
4. 20

**Answer:** Option 1: 30

*Explanation:* The generally accepted rule of thumb in statistics is that a sample size of n ≥ 30 is considered sufficiently large for the Central Limit Theorem to apply. This threshold is based on empirical evidence and practical experience, though the exact threshold may vary depending on the underlying distribution.

# Answer Key
1. Option 3 - Normally distributed (Core principle of CLT)
2. Option 4 - Mean = 50, SD = 1 (Application of standard error formula: σ/√n)
3. Option 1 - 30 (Common statistical threshold for CLT application)
