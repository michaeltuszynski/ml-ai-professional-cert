# Quiz 6: Recommendation Systems

## Question 1 (1 point)
Which of the following is NOT a suitable metric for evaluating recommendation systems?

**Options:**
1. Items that are promoted by advertisers
2. Items that are popular on the service
3. Items that have not yet been implemented
4. Items that are predicted to have high ratings

**Answer:** Option 3: Items that have not yet been implemented

Explanation: Recommendation systems can only evaluate based on existing items and data. Items that haven't been implemented yet have no data to analyze, making them impossible to use as evaluation metrics. Valid metrics include popularity, predicted ratings, and even promotional items (though this may introduce bias).

## Question 2 (1 point)
What are the systems that use a combination of metrics for recommendation called?

**Options:**
1. Alpha recommendation systems
2. Item recommendation systems
3. User factor systems
4. Hybrid recommendation systems

**Answer:** Option 4: Hybrid recommendation systems

Explanation: Hybrid recommendation systems are defined as systems that combine multiple recommendation approaches or metrics to generate recommendations. This combination allows them to leverage the strengths of different methods while mitigating their individual weaknesses.

## Question 3 (1 point)
Consider an item factors matrix that tells you there are two factor values for five different items. What does Z equal in this instance?

**Options:**
1. 2
2. 7
3. 3
4. 5

**Answer:** Option 1: 2

Explanation: In an item factors matrix, Z represents the number of factors (features) per item. Given that each item has two factor values, Z equals 2. The number of items (5) represents the number of rows in the matrix, not the Z value.

## Answer Key
1. Option 3 - Items that have not yet been implemented (Cannot evaluate non-existent items)
2. Option 4 - Hybrid recommendation systems (Systems combining multiple recommendation approaches)
3. Option 1 - 2 (Number of factors per item in the matrix)
