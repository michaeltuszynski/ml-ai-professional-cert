# Module 19 Live Session Summary: Recommender Systems

## Session Overview

This live session focused on understanding and implementing different types of recommender systems, using a movie recommendation system as a practical example. The session covered both theoretical concepts and hands-on implementation using the TMDb 5,000 movie dataset.

## Key Topics Covered

### 1. Introduction to Recommender Systems
- One of the oldest machine learning mechanisms
- Widely used in services like Netflix, YouTube, Spotify, and Amazon
- Primary goal: Enhance user experience by suggesting relevant products/content
- Real-world applications in various domains (entertainment, e-commerce, etc.)

### 2. Types of Recommender Systems

#### A. Demographic Filtering
- Most basic form of recommendation
- Based on overall popularity and general trends
- Features:
  - Provides generalized recommendations
  - Often seasonally influenced (e.g., Halloween movies in October)
  - Not personalized to individual users
  - Example: Netflix's "Top 10 in Your Country"

#### B. Content-Based Filtering
- More sophisticated than demographic filtering
- Suggests items similar to what the user is currently viewing
- Features:
  - Based on item characteristics and similarities
  - Doesn't require user history
  - Common in e-commerce (e.g., similar products on Amazon)
  - Example: Suggesting Harry Potter 2 after watching Harry Potter 1

#### C. Collaborative Filtering
- Most advanced type covered in the session
- Combines user behavior and item similarities
- Features:
  - Matches users with similar tastes
  - Uses historical user interaction data
  - Cross-references user preferences
  - Example: "Users who bought this also bought..."

### 3. Practical Implementation

#### Dataset Used
- TMDb 5,000 movie dataset
- Two main components:
  1. Movie metadata (ID, cast, crew)
  2. Technical details (budget, genre, keywords)

#### Implementation Steps
1. Data Loading and Preprocessing
   - Merging multiple datasets
   - Handling movie metadata
   - Processing technical information

2. Rating System
   - Using IMDb's weighted rating formula
   - Considering both rating value and number of votes
   - Minimum vote threshold implementation

## Key Takeaways

1. **Multiple Approaches**: Modern recommender systems often combine multiple types of filtering to maximize effectiveness

2. **Practical Considerations**:
   - Need to handle bias in user ratings
   - Importance of having sufficient data
   - Balance between popularity and personalization

3. **Real-World Applications**:
   - Different industries require different approaches
   - Need to adapt metrics based on the specific use case
   - Importance of user experience in recommendation systems

## Technical Implementation Notes

- Used Python for implementation
- Leveraged pandas for data manipulation
- Implemented IMDb's weighted rating formula
- Demonstrated practical code examples for each type of filtering

## Additional Resources

The session included a comprehensive Jupyter notebook demonstrating the implementation of all three types of recommender systems, from basic demographic filtering to advanced collaborative filtering techniques.
