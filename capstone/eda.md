# Capstone Project: Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA)

## Overview

In this module, you will work on performing exploratory data analysis (EDA) to develop an initial report for your capstone project. You will:

- Use EDA to reveal insights beyond formal modeling and hypothesis testing
- Clean your data and apply feature engineering techniques
- Create visualizations to understand your findings
- Develop a baseline ML model for comparison in Module 24

> 📝 Note: Module 24 will focus on including additional models, cleaning code, and making work presentable for both technical and non-technical audiences. This module focuses on the core analysis work.

## Deliverables

1. Jupyter notebook(s) containing your analysis
2. Updated README.md with completed results section
   - If you've changed methodologies or datasets since Module 17, ensure these changes are reflected

## Submission Instructions

1. Post both your README.md and Jupyter notebooks to your GitHub Repository
2. Submit a link to your repository

> ⏱️ Average completion time: 15 hours
