# Working Memory: Falls Risk Prediction Project

## Current State (as of last session)

### Completed Tasks
1. Exploratory Data Analysis
   - Analyzed falls distribution (11.8% falls, 88.2% no falls)
   - Examined mobility aid usage
   - Created visualizations for key variables
   - Handled missing values and special codes

2. Baseline Model Development
   - Implemented logistic regression with class balancing
   - ROC AUC Score: 0.696
   - Sensitivity: 0.624
   - Specificity: 0.674

3. Documentation
   - Created comprehensive README.md
   - Documented methodology and findings
   - Set up project structure

### Key Files
- falls_prediction_eda.ipynb: Main analysis notebook
- README.md: Project documentation
- Data source: NHATS Round 13 dataset (NHATS_Round_13_SP_File.dta)
  Available at: https://nhats.org/researcher/data-access/public-use-files
  Note: Free registration required to access the public use files

### Recent Changes
- Fixed dimensionality error in feature creation
- Improved data preprocessing pipeline
- Added model performance visualizations
- Created separate visualizations for falls-related variables
- Corrected dataset reference from ELSA to NHATS

### Current Metrics
1. Falls Distribution:
   - Falls (Class 1): 1012 (11.8%)
   - No Falls (Class 0): 7585 (88.2%)

2. Model Performance:
   - ROC AUC: 0.696
   - Sensitivity: 0.624 (62.4% falls correctly identified)
   - Specificity: 0.674 (67.4% non-falls correctly identified)

### Features Used
- uses_any_mobility_aid
- hc13worryfall (worry about falls)
- pe13flruppain (pain indicator)
- fl13balstands (balance indicator)
- fl13charstnds (chair stands indicator)
- fl13wlkingrse (walking indicator)

## Next Steps
1. Feature Engineering
   - Create interaction terms
   - Add more health indicators

2. Model Improvements
   - Implement Random Forests/XGBoost
   - Feature selection
   - Ensemble methods

3. Additional Analysis
   - Temporal patterns
   - Demographic subgroups
   - Intervention impact

## Requirements Status
All requirements from eda.md have been met:
✓ Project Organization
✓ Syntax and Code Quality
✓ Visualizations
✓ Data Cleaning and EDA
✓ Modeling

## Notes for Next Session
- Consider adding more markdown explanations in notebook
- Potential to explore additional features from ELSA dataset
- May want to analyze feature importance in more detail
- Could benefit from cross-validation in next iteration

## Questions to Address
1. Are there other relevant variables in NHATS dataset not yet considered?
2. Would stratified k-fold cross-validation improve model evaluation?
3. Should we consider feature selection methods before moving to more complex models?
