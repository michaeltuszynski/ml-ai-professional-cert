Capstone Project Overview Overview This program’ s capstone will reflect the concepts and technical knowledge you have acquired throughout the program, and it will showcase your ability to develop and answer a question of interest using the tools you have learned.

Your final capstone project will focus o n both the application of a predictive model and your ability to communicate your findings.

By the end of Module 24, you will have completed the following: • Build a predictive model using supervised or unsupervised learning techniques on a dataset of your choosin g • Develop a technical write -up in Jupyter Notebook posted on your GitHub repositor `y` • Create a non -technical report describing your finding s Timeline/De livera bles Module 6: Draft the Problem Statemen t In Module 6, you will define your problem statement and develop a prospectus of the project.

The prospectus provides a general overview of the question you will be asking, the data you require to answer the question, and the techniques you might use to answer the question.

# Modules 11 –14: First One -on-One Session with Your Program Leade r Sometime during these modules, you and your Program Leader will find a mutually agreeable time to talk synchronously about the problem statement you articulated in Module 6.

Your Program Leader may: • Help you refine your initial question and data need s • Suggest where to source the data you will need • Suggest methodologies for answering your question.

Remember that your Program Leader may propose unfamiliar methodologies that better serve your needs.

# Module 16: Finalize the Problem Statemen t In Module 16, you will submit your formal problem proposal, including: • The research question you intend to answe r • Expected data sources and structur e • Expected result s • Expected technique s Module 20: Initial Report and **ED** A In Module 20, you will submit the following: • A completed Jupyter notebook with your problem statement/question, data sources/structure, results, and techniques used (essentially, a fully built out version of what you submitted in Module 16 ) Modules 21 –23: Second One -on-One Session with Your Program Leade r After you submit your initial findings, you and your Program Leader will find a mutually agreeable time to go through your results to: • Identify any gaps/errors in the finding s • Suggest possible further explorations (after the program ) • Answer questions about the non -technical repor t Module 24: Final Analysis and Repor t In Module 24, you will submit your non -technical report describing your capstone project.

This report is designed to accompany your Jupyter notebook, providing a non-technical write -up that covers your problem, results, important findings, and suggestions for next steps.

To help you structure your report, we have provided the following template for your reference: Final Report Template
