1.  **Define the Problem Statement:** Provide a well-defined problem
    statement that clearly articulates the goals, challenges, and
    potential benefits of your machine learning solution.

2.  **Model Outcomes or Predictions:** Identify the type of learning
    (classification or regression) and specify the expected output of
    your selected model. Determine whether supervised or unsupervised
    learning algorithms will be used.

3.  **Data Acquisition:** The deliverable at this step is to identify
    what data you plan to acquire and use with your model. For the best
    results, data should come from multiple sources and your analysis
    for including specific data should be clear. Please provide a clear
    visualization to assess the data's potential to solve the problem as
    well.

4.  **Data Preprocessing/Preparation:** For this deliverable, you are
    tasked with detailing how you cleaned the data for your notebook. 

<!-- -->

a.  What techniques did you use to ensure your data was free of missing
    values, and inconsistencies? 

b.  How did you split the data into training and test sets?

c.  Please include any necessary analysis and encoding steps you took as
    well.

<!-- -->

5.  **Modeling:** For this deliverable, please document your selection
    of machine learning algorithms that you selected for your problem
    statement from the first deliverable.

6.  **Model Evaluation:** Share your model evaluation here. What types
    of models did you consider for your problem (classification,
    regression, unsupervised)?  Articulate the evaluation metrics you
    used and how you determined which model was most optimal for your
    problem.
