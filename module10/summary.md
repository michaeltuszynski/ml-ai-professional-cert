## Video 3: Modeling (Part 1)
### Key Concepts
1. Stochastic Processes
   - Ordered sequence of random variables
   - Denoted as Y_t (t from 1 to T)

### Important Properties
1. Stationarity
   - Statistical properties remain constant over time
   - Mean, variance, correlations are time-invariant
   - Marginal distributions are identical

2. Independence
   - Random variables are mutually independent
   - Past values don't influence future values

### Special Cases
1. IID (Independent and Identically Distributed)
   - Both stationary and independent

2. Gaussian White Noise Process
   - IID process with Gaussian distribution
   - Zero mean and unit variance

## Video 4: Modeling (Part 2)
### Focus: Autocorrelation Analysis
1. Autocorrelation Matrix
   - Correlations between pairs of random variables
   - Structure for stationary processes
   - Constant along diagonals

2. Autocorrelation Function (ACF)
   - Collects values along diagonals
   - Plots correlation vs lag
   - Typically decays with lag

### Implementation
- Using statsmodels package
- Sample autocorrelation computation
- Visualization and interpretation

2. Analysis Steps
   - Plotting original data
   - Computing differences
   - Analyzing autocorrelations

## Videos 6-7: Decomposition
### Components of Time Series
1. Trend
   - Long-term behavior
   - Overall direction

2. Seasonality
   - Periodic behavior
   - Known, constant period

3. Cycles
   - Non-periodic variations
   - Break from trend

4. Residue
   - Remaining variation
   - Should be stationary

### Decomposition Process
1. Trend Extraction
   - Smoothing with filters
   - Filter length > period

2. Seasonal Component
   - Segment data into periods
   - Average overlapped segments

3. Residue Analysis
   - Check for stationarity
   - Verify model quality

   - Loading sunspots data
   - Setting datetime index
   - Splitting into training/testing

2. Trend Extraction
   - Creating smoothing filter
   - Applying convolution
   - Extrapolation handling

3. Seasonal Component
   - Identifying seasons
   - Normalizing seasonal data
   - Creating template

4. Model Assembly
   - Combining trend and seasonal
   - Computing residuals
   - Error metrics calculation

## Videos 10-11: ARMA Models
### Key Components
1. Moving Average (MA) Process
   - Order q
   - Uses past noise values
   - Coefficients: θ1 through θq

2. Autoregressive (AR) Process
   - Order p
   - Uses past output values
   - Coefficients: φ1 through φp

3. ARMA Process
   - Combination of AR and MA
   - Order (p,q)
   - More general model class

### Analysis Tools
1. ACF (Autocorrelation Function)
   - Identifies MA order
   - Shows decay patterns

2. PACF (Partial Autocorrelation Function)
   - Identifies AR order
   - Shows structure

## Videos 12-13: ARMA Implementation and Conclusion

### Best Practices
1. Decomposition Approach
   - Best for long-term trends
