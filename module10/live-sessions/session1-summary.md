## Time Series Analysis Overview

### What is Time Series Data?
- Data collected at regular intervals over time
- Key characteristic: Time component is essential and observations are ordered
- Examples:
  - Finance: Stock prices, interest rates, cryptocurrency prices
  - Weather: Temperature, rainfall, humidity
  - Retail: Sales data, customer footfall
  - Healthcare: Patient vitals, medical readings
  - Economics: GDP, unemployment rates, inflation
  - Energy: Electricity usage, gas consumption
  - Social media: Engagement metrics
  - Traffic patterns

### Key Concepts
1. Serial Correlation
   - Observations closer in time tend to be more similar
   - Example: Today's weather is more similar to yesterday's than last month's

2. Trend
   - Overall direction/pattern in the data over time
   - Can be upward, downward, or stable

3. Seasonality
   - Recurring patterns at regular intervals
   - Example: Retail sales peaking in December
   - Example: Traffic patterns during rush hours

4. Stationarity
   - Statistical properties (mean, variance, autocorrelation) remain constant over time
   - Important for ARMA modeling

## Classical Decomposition Model
- Combines trend and seasonality components
- Similar to linear regression but with time-based components
- Steps:
  1. Convert time data to numerical format
  2. Apply log transformation if needed (for non-constant variance)
  3. Model trend using linear regression
  4. Model seasonality using dummy variables
  5. Combine trend and seasonality predictions

### Model Performance
- Evaluate using metrics like RMSE
- Example showed:
  - Training RMSE: 12 passengers
  - Test RMSE: 52 passengers
- Can be improved using more advanced methods

## Advanced Time Series Methods
- ARMA (Autoregressive Moving Average)
- ARIMA (Adds Integration component for non-stationary data)
- SARIMA (Seasonal ARIMA)
- Prophet (Facebook's forecasting tool)
- Neural Network approaches (LSTM, GRU)

## Best Practices
- Always split data chronologically (not randomly)
- Consider appropriate time granularity for your problem
- Handle non-constant variance with transformations
- Validate model performance on test set
- Consider domain context when interpreting results
