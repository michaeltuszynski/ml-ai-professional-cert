# Module 10 Live Session 2 Summary

## Session Overview
This live session covered key aspects of Time Series Analysis and Forecasting, with discussions on capstone projects and general course logistics.

## Key Topics Discussed

### Capstone Project Updates
- Students shared how recent modules have influenced their capstone project ideas
- Examples included:
  - Telemetry services data analysis for router/switch latency
  - Heart attack prediction in female populations using logistic regression
- Project scope discussion emphasized importance of limiting scope and focusing on specific predictions

### Time Series Analysis & Forecasting
- Distinction between data suitable for time series analysis vs. other analyses
- Key characteristics of time series data:
  - Data points ordered in time
  - Regular intervals
  - Values influenced by previous outcomes
  - Each data point corresponds to specific time

### Problem-Solving Approaches
1. Front-to-Back Approach:
   - Starting with raw data
   - Following sequential steps to reach final analysis
   - Example: Data cleaning → formatting → analysis

2. Back-to-Front Approach:
   - Starting with desired outcome
   - Working backwards to determine requirements
   - Example: Starting with prediction goal → determining model needs → identifying data requirements

### Tools & Resources
- Introduction to statsmodels package
- Available datasets for practice and potential capstone projects
- Documentation for new methods and functions

## Course Updates & Reminders
- Module 10 due date: November 13th
- Practical Applications 2 upcoming
- One-on-one consultations for capstone projects starting in Module 11
- Support available through ticket system for specific questions

## Best Practices Highlighted
- Importance of model evaluation in real-world applications
- Data cleaning and preparation steps for time series analysis
- Problem decomposition strategies
- Using ticket system for specific questions outside office hours

## Technical Concepts
- Converting string dates to datetime format
- Time series data preparation
- Importance of matching variable names in assignments
- Handling data at different time frequencies
