1
00:00:01.020 --> 00:00:01.520
Great.

2
00:00:02.020 --> 00:00:07.680
Francesca Vera: I've started the recording welcome to everyone. We're just waiting to see if people trickle in. But

3
00:00:08.029 --> 00:00:10.786
Francesca Vera: I just wanted to get a sense.

4
00:00:11.240 --> 00:00:14.060
Francesca Vera: how how the past few modules.

5
00:00:14.515 --> 00:00:20.920
Francesca Vera: and the topics covered, including the topic of Time Series analysis, which was this week's module, you know.

6
00:00:21.180 --> 00:00:23.450
Francesca Vera: have any of these modules affected

7
00:00:23.600 --> 00:00:38.660
Francesca Vera: your thoughts on the Capstone project. Maybe one of you proposed a project that looks at data with Timestamps, and this time series analysis is really relevant, or maybe

8
00:00:38.770 --> 00:00:48.149
Francesca Vera: the model of, you know, the method of linear regression from a few weeks ago. That's going to be really useful. Any any thoughts on how

9
00:00:48.680 --> 00:00:53.370
Francesca Vera: the recent things we've discussed have affected how you're thinking about your project.

10
00:00:54.750 --> 00:00:59.030
Kiran: Yeah, for time series is going to help me at my work also. So that's.

11
00:01:00.360 --> 00:01:02.040
Kiran: Using our

12
00:01:02.520 --> 00:01:05.939
Kiran: changing my problem statement to time series, if possible.

13
00:01:06.690 --> 00:01:15.159
Francesca Vera: And if you don't mind, if you're willing to share what? What is the problem statement that you're interested in like, how does that relate to time series.

14
00:01:15.670 --> 00:01:24.469
Kiran: So so I work on you know, telemetry services. So I capture data from routers and switches. So.

15
00:01:24.910 --> 00:01:38.149
Kiran: It. And it is time series where I find a latency packet size, you know. Wrap time. All these things relevant to the data that we receive from the routers and switches.

16
00:01:38.986 --> 00:01:46.720
Kiran: Yeah, I would like to apply this time series on that to measure different latencies at different time.

17
00:01:46.920 --> 00:01:47.810
Kiran: cities.

18
00:01:48.720 --> 00:01:52.839
Francesca Vera: Very interesting. Thank you. Thank you for sharing, Carmen. Your hand is up.

19
00:01:53.700 --> 00:02:02.649
Carmen P.: Yeah, I think that is, I thought was in the right part, but based on the last 2 models modules. I'm so confused because my

20
00:02:03.931 --> 00:02:10.519
Carmen P.: my, my original problem statement was like a to create a model, to predict heart attack.

21
00:02:11.220 --> 00:02:13.480
Carmen P.: In female populations.

22
00:02:14.830 --> 00:02:17.530
Carmen P.: So I thought it was like a logistic regression.

23
00:02:18.250 --> 00:02:25.550
Carmen P.: But now, because my, why is categorical, based on the learning that I have done through the models

24
00:02:25.670 --> 00:02:34.540
Carmen P.: probably is not gonna be logistic regression, but mostly classification. I know we're not there yet, but based on research. I have done so I don't know how.

25
00:02:36.250 --> 00:02:38.460
Carmen P.: Yeah, how can I

26
00:02:38.770 --> 00:02:44.230
Carmen P.: apply the model to remain logistic regression without changing the Y.

27
00:02:44.230 --> 00:02:55.120
Francesca Vera: Yeah, actually, it's you, you're right. And we're gonna see in my last slide today, logistic regression which we could come in. But logistic regression actually does.

28
00:02:55.746 --> 00:03:00.500
Francesca Vera: Is a classification algorithm. I know it has regression in the name.

29
00:03:00.690 --> 00:03:08.990
Francesca Vera: But logistic regression is actually a classification algorithm. So I think you're right to use logistic regression.

30
00:03:08.990 --> 00:03:10.480
Carmen P.: Okay. Good.

31
00:03:10.480 --> 00:03:38.219
Francesca Vera: For your topic linear regression, which we did do a few weeks ago. That's for regression. That would not work, but logistic regression. I know it's a subtle difference in the word logistic regression will actually be a good algorithm for your problem. It is a classification one. It's a funny little thing with the name regression. But logistic regression is a classification algorithm.

32
00:03:38.220 --> 00:03:43.397
Carmen P.: Oh, okay, good. Because I was getting mixed up. So I guess I'm in the right part. I guess.

33
00:03:43.890 --> 00:03:54.409
Francesca Vera: Great and then I see. Yeah, of course, and I see a few things, Mike said. Limiting the scope of the capstone. I think that's across the board

34
00:03:55.150 --> 00:04:01.860
Francesca Vera: going to be really key for everyone's capstone, you know, limiting the scope. And that means.

35
00:04:01.890 --> 00:04:08.289
Francesca Vera: you know, limiting the thing you're predicting, making sure you're really just focusing on predicting one outcome, not

36
00:04:08.400 --> 00:04:15.299
Francesca Vera: necessarily multiple outcomes. You can have a lot of factors that lead to outcomes. For example, Carmen's project

37
00:04:15.330 --> 00:04:34.760
Francesca Vera: for predicting. You know, heart attack. You might have a lot of factors about each individual patient, but the outcome is just one outcome of risk of heart attack, maybe not risk of heart attack right? And so limiting the scope. I think that's a really really good insight, Mike. And then, Matt, unclear on the total

38
00:04:34.940 --> 00:04:39.600
Francesca Vera: picture. We have some tools, but it's more analysis and not really AI,

39
00:04:40.272 --> 00:04:44.699
Francesca Vera: so I'm gonna super just fast forward

40
00:04:44.930 --> 00:04:46.080
Francesca Vera: to

41
00:04:47.450 --> 00:04:52.009
Francesca Vera: the end. Actually, it'll be quicker if I do this the end and this might help you.

42
00:04:52.650 --> 00:04:53.870
Francesca Vera: Matt. So

43
00:04:54.300 --> 00:04:58.319
Francesca Vera: if you look down here hopefully, you can see my cursor. So

44
00:04:58.730 --> 00:05:10.900
Francesca Vera: your capstone project will focus on the application of a predictive model and communicating your findings around that model. Matt, if you feel like your project right now is more of just analysis.

45
00:05:10.990 --> 00:05:13.740
Francesca Vera: Think about what predictions

46
00:05:13.840 --> 00:05:18.010
Francesca Vera: like, what outcome can you predict, based on that analysis?

47
00:05:18.470 --> 00:05:37.180
Francesca Vera: Because really what you're going to try to do by the end of your capstone project is, apply these machine learning concepts. You know these AI tools. You're going to make a prediction. And so we kind of see that with time series analysis, right? Like when we're looking at past data.

48
00:05:37.560 --> 00:05:44.010
Francesca Vera: And we're doing that time series analysis on past data, right? Like that's the data analysis, part of it.

49
00:05:44.120 --> 00:05:51.760
Francesca Vera: But there's that second part in our topic which is time series, analysis, and forecasting

50
00:05:51.860 --> 00:05:59.600
Francesca Vera: where the forecasting is going to be the prediction part. Right? We're using a lot of our time series analysis, our insights

51
00:05:59.680 --> 00:06:19.220
Francesca Vera: gain their observation of trends. Maybe various factors. We're using that to then forecast, maybe the next 10 years, maybe the next 100 seconds, maybe the next decade century. But that's the predictive element. So my recommendation, my challenge for you, Matt would be if you feel like your project right now is more of just data analysis.

52
00:06:20.530 --> 00:06:22.020
Francesca Vera: Think about what

53
00:06:22.110 --> 00:06:33.310
Francesca Vera: can you predict with that data analysis. So taking the heart attack example again, if I'm going to do a lot of analysis, and I notice oh, patient with this profile

54
00:06:33.510 --> 00:06:36.760
Francesca Vera: in the past have been more at risk.

55
00:06:36.880 --> 00:06:42.509
Francesca Vera: Maybe my prediction will be given a new patient profile. Can I predict

56
00:06:42.670 --> 00:06:44.710
Francesca Vera: if they'll be at risk?

57
00:06:44.980 --> 00:06:47.369
Francesca Vera: Do you get what I'm saying, Does that make sense?

58
00:06:48.558 --> 00:06:54.320
Francesca Vera: But thank you for bringing that up, because I think that was one of the biggest challenges that I saw

59
00:06:54.400 --> 00:06:58.360
Francesca Vera: in the proposal. The the project

60
00:06:58.370 --> 00:07:07.740
Francesca Vera: or the problem statement was, a lot of people had great ideas on data analysis. So then the challenge is, okay, what do I want to do with that data analysis?

61
00:07:08.195 --> 00:07:10.270
Francesca Vera: Yeah, no, no worries. Matt. Yeah.

62
00:07:10.270 --> 00:07:11.610
Kiran: I haven't

63
00:07:12.040 --> 00:07:13.139
Kiran: sorry. Go ahead. Yeah.

64
00:07:13.140 --> 00:07:14.609
Francesca Vera: No no go ahead.

65
00:07:14.900 --> 00:07:26.353
Kiran: Yeah. So usually, we keep you know, time slot constant across the data, right? Like in time series. Either we have every month data or every year data or every second data.

66
00:07:27.050 --> 00:07:33.479
Kiran: Is there are there any modules in time series where we can handle data at a different frequencies like, you know.

67
00:07:33.480 --> 00:07:34.080
Francesca Vera: Yeah.

68
00:07:34.411 --> 00:07:40.710
Kiran: Like like. You know, data for every second, followed by every minute, followed by every hour like that.

69
00:07:40.710 --> 00:07:45.289
Francesca Vera: Yeah, no, that's a great question. And I am actually pulling out

70
00:07:45.849 --> 00:07:48.969
Francesca Vera: the canvas, because there's a great

71
00:07:49.160 --> 00:07:57.070
Francesca Vera: bit here, let me transfer it so that you can see it on the share screen. All right, does everyone. Can everyone see this on canvas?

72
00:07:57.140 --> 00:07:59.270
Francesca Vera: So time series data.

73
00:07:59.640 --> 00:08:00.910
Francesca Vera: you can see

74
00:08:00.970 --> 00:08:05.449
Francesca Vera: types of time series data. You actually have a lot of time series data.

75
00:08:05.480 --> 00:08:09.119
Francesca Vera: And what you're saying reminds me of this one.

76
00:08:10.370 --> 00:08:11.320
Francesca Vera: Are you.

77
00:08:11.320 --> 00:08:16.270
Kiran: It's a regular, but you know, different. Regular

78
00:08:16.820 --> 00:08:19.830
Francesca Vera: Oh, I see. So you would have multiple.

79
00:08:20.800 --> 00:08:22.719
Francesca Vera: Okay, and

80
00:08:23.920 --> 00:08:25.829
Francesca Vera: that would then be.

81
00:08:26.300 --> 00:08:36.180
Kiran: Then I would like to know what would be the prediction if if the frequency increases versus like, you know, one second interval data versus 1 min interval data

82
00:08:36.539 --> 00:08:42.860
Kiran: is my system going to act differently when I have 1 min interval data versus one second interval data.

83
00:08:43.780 --> 00:08:46.050
Francesca Vera: I think that is something that

84
00:08:46.070 --> 00:08:46.970
Francesca Vera: you

85
00:08:48.010 --> 00:09:12.370
Francesca Vera: It would be very fair for you to actually explore that. If that's something you're concerned with, if you remember. So I loaded this sunspot data. I was going to get to it later. But if you think back to the lecture, which might be a while ago. You'll notice that when doing the sunspot data and looking at sort of

86
00:09:12.830 --> 00:09:14.030
Francesca Vera: the

87
00:09:16.680 --> 00:09:29.200
Francesca Vera: the the differences on to see how the trend. You know it. It wasn't a stationary it. It did not show a stationary plot. But then, if you look

88
00:09:29.220 --> 00:09:30.380
Francesca Vera: over

89
00:09:30.640 --> 00:09:42.130
Francesca Vera: 20 lags that shows a different plot from 200 lags. So your exploration in your time series data analysis can look

90
00:09:42.560 --> 00:09:55.339
Francesca Vera: at those different time intervals, right? Like, let's say your data is collected in seconds. You can look at intervals of per second. And then, if you just change those intervals to 60 seconds, we know, that's the same as

91
00:09:55.850 --> 00:09:59.059
Francesca Vera: over a minute. And so in the same way, you can

92
00:10:00.720 --> 00:10:14.329
Francesca Vera: imagine that it's 1 data set. But the way you're looking at it is different, because you're looking at looking at it like maybe one second intervals, and then 60 second intervals, or like

93
00:10:15.020 --> 00:10:22.699
Francesca Vera: 3,600 second intervals. Right? So does that answer your question? Am I understanding that correctly?

94
00:10:23.320 --> 00:10:30.421
Kiran: Yeah, yeah, I I think I missed that session. Maybe I need to revisit and then get traffic. Yeah.

95
00:10:30.760 --> 00:10:55.870
Francesca Vera: Yes, so here, you in the in the plots, and maybe I can go. I'll go through it later and kind of show that. But you can see that one of the examples from the lecture shows where lags are 200, and that will look very different from when it's 20. And so thinking about scale, because time, obviously

96
00:10:56.347 --> 00:11:05.160
Francesca Vera: different scales, like 60 seconds, is not the same as one second. It might be a an interesting thing to look over, and then.

97
00:11:05.960 --> 00:11:19.390
Manish Goenka: Francisca. I have a question. I'm behind on submitting my capstone project, is it? I just caught up to my coursework, so I'm good in the course and module 10. When is the latest by which we can submit the capstone.

98
00:11:20.758 --> 00:11:24.590
Francesca Vera: So I'll go into modules, and

99
00:11:24.630 --> 00:11:28.719
Francesca Vera: there is up here in

100
00:11:29.810 --> 00:11:31.510
Francesca Vera: program orientation.

101
00:11:31.870 --> 00:11:40.039
Francesca Vera: You'll be able to find everything about your capstone. This is really useful, as you can see. I've been onto this page many times, because I know exactly where it is.

102
00:11:41.520 --> 00:11:47.300
Francesca Vera: in the next few weeks. Actually think, starting next week. Module 11

103
00:11:47.350 --> 00:12:01.709
Francesca Vera: to module 14. You'll each have the opportunity to meet one on one with your learning facilitator, and by module 16. So I think that's your question. By module 16. You will need to submit your formal problem proposal.

104
00:12:02.058 --> 00:12:04.849
Manish Goenka: We have a few weeks. Okay, thank you.

105
00:12:04.850 --> 00:12:09.459
Francesca Vera: Great. And yes, you have a few weeks plus a 1 on one session with your program leader.

106
00:12:10.160 --> 00:12:10.940
Francesca Vera: Thank you.

107
00:12:10.940 --> 00:12:11.659
Manish Goenka: Thank you.

108
00:12:11.920 --> 00:12:27.280
Francesca Vera: Great and to go back to the earlier question. I think, Kieran, you asked matt put some examples in the chat that might be useful to you as well about looking at timescale

109
00:12:29.740 --> 00:12:43.400
Francesca Vera: cool. Well, thank you all so much. I think that was a really productive check-in. I'll think about doing those more often, and I'm glad to hear that you've been thinking about your projects as you've been going through the modules.

110
00:12:43.940 --> 00:12:47.700
Francesca Vera: My agenda for today. Just very quick. Faqs.

111
00:12:48.296 --> 00:12:51.573
Francesca Vera: I may skip over going over.

112
00:12:52.520 --> 00:13:02.730
Francesca Vera: I may. I may skip past going over prior notes, and then, if we have time at the end. Going back to these. These were just some observations from previous

113
00:13:03.137 --> 00:13:09.380
Francesca Vera: assignments that would probably be useful to you moving forward, but I can jump back to that

114
00:13:09.937 --> 00:13:26.610
Francesca Vera: at the end. Week 10 overview. So we're in week 10, looking at time series analysis and forecasting and then looking at forward ahead. Your capstone projects particularly, because, starting, I believe, Module 11, you will have.

115
00:13:26.740 --> 00:13:34.790
Francesca Vera: You were each entitled to a 1-on-one discussion about your capstone project with your learning facilitators, and I'll go over that at the end.

116
00:13:36.720 --> 00:13:38.253
Francesca Vera: So I've

117
00:13:39.390 --> 00:13:50.740
Francesca Vera: noted that many of the previous office hours attendees. Maybe you feel the same. Have have expressed, maybe needing more time to discuss

118
00:13:50.750 --> 00:13:52.900
Francesca Vera: with a learning facilitator.

119
00:13:53.407 --> 00:14:03.849
Francesca Vera: Some questions that perhaps don't need to be raised during office hours. If they're a very specific question about your progress or about your project.

120
00:14:04.060 --> 00:14:08.632
Francesca Vera: and not not knowing where or how to do that.

121
00:14:10.030 --> 00:14:17.379
Francesca Vera: One thing that I have noticed recently, and I've really appreciated actually, is that I've been getting more ticket requests

122
00:14:17.560 --> 00:14:28.228
Francesca Vera: on a specific topic. And people who are submitting. These ticket requests have even provided either screenshots or

123
00:14:28.790 --> 00:14:48.449
Francesca Vera: you know, quotes from the certain module or quotes from the code assignment, and I think you know, depending on which learning facilitator receives your ticket. This is a great way to get more detailed feedback, or answers to a specific question that you might not want to bring up at office hours.

124
00:14:48.630 --> 00:14:53.480
Francesca Vera: So an example of this was, as you all know. If you submit an assignment late.

125
00:14:54.029 --> 00:15:11.100
Francesca Vera: You get your grade, but you don't get as in-depth feedback as you would get if you submit your assignment on time. That's the benefit of submitting on time and definitely for the 1st practical applications. One.

126
00:15:11.120 --> 00:15:18.109
Francesca Vera: there was a lot of feedback to give, because it was very much your 1st time really putting together a full project, which was great.

127
00:15:18.440 --> 00:15:27.190
Francesca Vera: but that meant people who submitted late did not necessarily get feedback to the same degree as people who submitted on time. So I did get a ticket.

128
00:15:27.370 --> 00:15:52.339
Francesca Vera: asking, hey? I know I submitted a late practical applications. One, but I really want to know how I can improve on, say, my visualizations, how I can improve on my code, syntax, etc. And so, getting that from the learner, I was able to just pull up their submission for practical applications, one, and write out feedback for the criteria and submit that, and then close the ticket.

129
00:15:52.580 --> 00:15:54.580
Francesca Vera: And that was a way that

130
00:15:55.060 --> 00:15:58.470
Francesca Vera: this learner who wanted specific feedback was able to get

131
00:15:58.610 --> 00:16:08.619
Francesca Vera: specific feedback without having to bring it into this office hour session and have, you know, 12 of you. Listen to me. Give one person feedback. Right? So that's a great example.

132
00:16:08.840 --> 00:16:32.670
Francesca Vera: Another example was a learner had encountered a new function. You know, we're learning new functions all the time learning about new packages, learning about new classes all the time, and they were like, Hey, this colab notebook refers to a new function that was brought up in lecture once for 3 seconds, and never brought up again.

133
00:16:33.180 --> 00:16:42.830
Francesca Vera: Can you give me things to help me learn about this new function, or can you help explain why this new function works for this colab?

134
00:16:42.910 --> 00:16:46.049
Francesca Vera: You know this, this colab question.

135
00:16:46.070 --> 00:16:54.969
Francesca Vera: And so these are just examples, ways that if you have a specific question that you think. Okay, it's not really the right place to bring it up in office hours.

136
00:16:55.860 --> 00:17:07.739
Francesca Vera: Try to submit a ticket with all the relevant information, the relevant details, and hopefully, you'll be able to get the direct response in that in that format. So just wanted to

137
00:17:07.839 --> 00:17:11.959
Francesca Vera: flag that for you if you are looking to get specific feedback or have

138
00:17:12.170 --> 00:17:16.100
Francesca Vera: a longer discussion on something that you encountered.

139
00:17:17.010 --> 00:17:40.689
Francesca Vera: I also got requests about the answer key for the try it exercises, I am aware there are not answer keys posted, so I'm still following up on getting the answer key, for try it exercises. So stay tuned. I know people have been submitting tickets to ask for help with some of the try it exercises. So in the meantime, that should still work

140
00:17:43.610 --> 00:17:44.976
Francesca Vera: codeo issues.

141
00:17:45.830 --> 00:17:47.030
Francesca Vera: So

142
00:17:47.570 --> 00:17:57.030
Francesca Vera: by week 10, I'm sure you're all very familiar with the Codeo interface, and that there have been some issues that crop up depending on the module.

143
00:17:58.030 --> 00:18:01.612
Francesca Vera: Firstly, if you've noted a codeo issue,

144
00:18:02.635 --> 00:18:15.059
Francesca Vera: submission was a common one, but sometimes something incorrect in the answer key or not understanding why you were penalized for marks. We are working on them. Sometimes I'll leave a ticket open

145
00:18:15.230 --> 00:18:22.169
Francesca Vera: and just respond like we're looking into Codeo on your behalf. But that ticket remains open. We're working on that.

146
00:18:24.110 --> 00:18:45.520
Francesca Vera: note that you may edit your assignment submission an unlimited number of times. So if you mark your assignment as incomplete after having marked it complete, maybe the day before, and you wanted to change something, you can go back and mark it as incomplete. Make your edits and then complete your assignment again. So

147
00:18:45.770 --> 00:18:59.150
Francesca Vera: this is really supposed to be your learning experience. It's not a test to see if you are, you know, passing on fail or failing on the 1st try. It's it's really not that kind of a

148
00:18:59.480 --> 00:19:04.480
Francesca Vera: kind of platform. Not that kind of a course. So it's it's a learning process. Maybe

149
00:19:04.750 --> 00:19:10.589
Francesca Vera: you got one question wrong the 1st time you want to go back and edit it, and

150
00:19:10.910 --> 00:19:18.770
Francesca Vera: sort of understand why, that 1st time you got it wrong you could do that. So please please feel free to go back to edit your submission

151
00:19:19.670 --> 00:19:35.420
Francesca Vera: in a previous module. There were some inconsistencies between the question and answer. Key. If you follow the prompt, the answer key will be adjusted, so no need to adjust your answer to the incorrect answer just to fit the answer, key.

152
00:19:35.430 --> 00:19:43.779
Francesca Vera: And please, please, I got a ticket about this recently. Make sure you match the output of your answer key exactly

153
00:19:44.040 --> 00:20:00.819
Francesca Vera: as the question asks it. So that means if you are given a variable name. If the data frame has set column names. Please do not change the variable name. Do not change the function. Name. Do not change the column names, you know. The answer key will match.

154
00:20:01.150 --> 00:20:11.479
Francesca Vera: We'll want you to match these these variable names function, names, etc. Exactly. So. If you're getting something wrong, even though your code is functionally correct.

155
00:20:11.500 --> 00:20:13.109
Francesca Vera: it may be because

156
00:20:13.150 --> 00:20:16.719
Francesca Vera: the names of your variables are not matching those of the answer key.

157
00:20:17.090 --> 00:20:23.759
Francesca Vera: So feel free to to go back and change those and just ultimately, if you were correct.

158
00:20:24.120 --> 00:20:39.550
Francesca Vera: your grades will end up being changed. To reflect this like, we would not penalize you for a code eo assignment. If you are correct, and that may get done, you know, on week 24 at the last week of the course or something. But do not worry if you are correct.

159
00:20:39.750 --> 00:20:43.880
Francesca Vera: you will get the credit you earned by being correct.

160
00:20:46.740 --> 00:20:56.700
Francesca Vera: Cool and so in the interest of time, I'll skip over some of these and jump back to it

161
00:20:57.480 --> 00:21:01.420
Francesca Vera: later, if time permits. But I'll

162
00:21:01.600 --> 00:21:04.310
Francesca Vera: then jump into

163
00:21:04.820 --> 00:21:07.054
Francesca Vera: the module itself.

164
00:21:08.010 --> 00:21:19.959
Francesca Vera: and field various questions. As I go through focusing on specific things. But if time permits, I'll go back to the general more general advice and feedback.

165
00:21:20.310 --> 00:21:27.799
Francesca Vera: So module, 10 time, series, analysis, and forecasting, we spoke about it a little bit at the start of this

166
00:21:28.533 --> 00:21:37.810
Francesca Vera: at the start of the icebreaker, and why these 2 things are important, but also why they're put together. A lot of

167
00:21:37.880 --> 00:21:44.069
Francesca Vera: what you are building towards for your capstone project is to be able to predict

168
00:21:44.220 --> 00:21:50.099
Francesca Vera: an outcome using machine learning techniques or using, you know, various AI techniques.

169
00:21:50.230 --> 00:22:06.969
Francesca Vera: You want to predict a future outcome. Right? And so that's why time series, analysis and forecasting are put together. You can almost think of it. As you know, if I'm given this data that requires some time series analysis. What can I do with that data? Well, I can forecast

170
00:22:07.050 --> 00:22:21.689
Francesca Vera: outcomes in the future. And that's really how I like to think of a lot of the various techniques and a lot of the real life problems that you encounter in the lecture videos or in the colab notebooks. For me, it's very much a question of.

171
00:22:21.930 --> 00:22:23.710
Francesca Vera: I have this data set.

172
00:22:24.270 --> 00:22:31.510
Francesca Vera: What can I learn from this data set? What insights can I extract? What patterns? How can I analyze it?

173
00:22:31.780 --> 00:22:39.260
Francesca Vera: And then my problem doesn't stop there right after I've done all of that hard work to really understand what the historical data has told me.

174
00:22:39.500 --> 00:22:43.330
Francesca Vera: I'm then asking myself, Okay, so what next? What can I do

175
00:22:43.740 --> 00:22:51.730
Francesca Vera: to, you know, to predict something important, relevant in the future, using all the hard work and all the analysis I did.

176
00:22:51.780 --> 00:22:58.149
Francesca Vera: So that's really one way you can just think about your capstone project. I have a data set.

177
00:22:58.560 --> 00:23:03.210
Francesca Vera: I want to do some really meaningful analysis on it. Once I'm done with that analysis.

178
00:23:03.300 --> 00:23:07.280
Francesca Vera: How can that help me predict something important, relevant in the future?

179
00:23:08.770 --> 00:23:11.439
Francesca Vera: So for time, series analysis, the

180
00:23:11.630 --> 00:23:28.109
Francesca Vera: 1st one is to apply a 1st learning outcome listed was to apply these tools to model and analyze real world data. And there's specific kinds of data that we are looking at and then to draw useful conclusions from this real world data.

181
00:23:28.330 --> 00:23:32.799
Francesca Vera: As I mentioned in previous office hours. I like to think of

182
00:23:32.840 --> 00:23:36.060
Francesca Vera: the knowledge checks and Codeo assignments as

183
00:23:36.460 --> 00:23:38.660
Francesca Vera: sort of mapping them. To which

184
00:23:38.960 --> 00:23:42.509
Francesca Vera: topic before I even start. So that I know.

185
00:23:42.640 --> 00:23:51.350
Francesca Vera: okay, if I'm gonna do forecasting problem section today, I have 3 things I want to finish. It's hard to jump

186
00:23:51.370 --> 00:23:59.130
Francesca Vera: from one thing to the next if you're still in the process of learning, and so I always like to break it down like this.

187
00:23:59.260 --> 00:24:04.600
Francesca Vera: So that I know, okay, I'm not really going to do codeo assignment one

188
00:24:04.630 --> 00:24:12.019
Francesca Vera: 10.1 and knowledge check 10.3 in the same seating. I like to keep them separate. So if that's helpful

189
00:24:12.050 --> 00:24:16.009
Francesca Vera: for you, this might be one way you can break down

190
00:24:16.030 --> 00:24:17.500
Francesca Vera: how to tackle the

191
00:24:17.550 --> 00:24:19.719
Francesca Vera: knowledge checks and Codeo assignments

192
00:24:24.140 --> 00:24:25.730
Francesca Vera: all right. So

193
00:24:26.440 --> 00:24:30.820
Francesca Vera: I left these blank because I had hoped for us to fill them in.

194
00:24:31.260 --> 00:24:33.660
Francesca Vera: And this is very much

195
00:24:33.830 --> 00:24:36.230
Francesca Vera: you know, a question of, when

196
00:24:36.520 --> 00:24:40.330
Francesca Vera: would we use time series analysis?

197
00:24:42.520 --> 00:24:46.350
Francesca Vera: I would love to have some examples of data sets

198
00:24:46.620 --> 00:24:48.339
Francesca Vera: that would not

199
00:24:49.210 --> 00:24:55.202
Francesca Vera: use time series analysis and data sets that would use time series analysis. So

200
00:24:55.800 --> 00:24:56.670
Francesca Vera: please.

201
00:24:57.760 --> 00:24:58.380
Francesca Vera: please

202
00:24:59.310 --> 00:25:05.289
Francesca Vera: get me started on that. Any any ideas of a data set where maybe time series analysis would not be the right

203
00:25:05.760 --> 00:25:07.129
Francesca Vera: right tool for it.

204
00:25:14.050 --> 00:25:15.960
Manish Goenka: Height of people in a population.

205
00:25:15.960 --> 00:25:16.780
Francesca Vera: Okay.

206
00:25:17.080 --> 00:25:19.439
Francesca Vera: Height of people

207
00:25:20.700 --> 00:25:23.670
Francesca Vera: in a population cool. Okay.

208
00:25:24.480 --> 00:25:25.680
Francesca Vera: any

209
00:25:25.920 --> 00:25:27.050
Francesca Vera: other

210
00:25:27.510 --> 00:25:28.520
Francesca Vera: things

211
00:25:29.110 --> 00:25:30.272
Francesca Vera: to do with

212
00:25:32.440 --> 00:25:41.170
Francesca Vera: data sets here, categorization. Okay, do you have an idea of a data set that would need categorization, like.

213
00:25:41.300 --> 00:25:44.539
Francesca Vera: what kind of data restaurant reviews. Okay.

214
00:25:46.850 --> 00:25:52.049
Francesca Vera: horsepower and gasoline. Okay? And images. So we have images.

215
00:25:52.330 --> 00:26:01.330
Francesca Vera: horsepower and gasoline, I take that is for different car models. Great. Okay. So now into the actual

216
00:26:02.311 --> 00:26:05.400
Francesca Vera: topic this this week, this module. What

217
00:26:05.460 --> 00:26:07.909
Francesca Vera: would I want to use time

218
00:26:07.980 --> 00:26:10.900
Francesca Vera: series stock prices over time.

219
00:26:12.640 --> 00:26:13.950
Francesca Vera: whether

220
00:26:14.030 --> 00:26:18.139
Francesca Vera: okay, weather and then sales. Okay?

221
00:26:19.170 --> 00:26:22.619
Francesca Vera: So can someone tell me, how? How did you

222
00:26:22.850 --> 00:26:27.840
Francesca Vera: come up with these versus these like, what were you? What were you thinking about

223
00:26:28.270 --> 00:26:30.330
Francesca Vera: when you were thinking about?

224
00:26:30.440 --> 00:26:36.079
Francesca Vera: You know what would use time, series, analysis, and what wouldn't use time series analysis.

225
00:26:39.060 --> 00:26:43.000
Kiran: If it's relevant to the time, then it comes to time, space.

226
00:26:43.350 --> 00:26:47.690
Francesca Vera: Yes. So if it's related to time

227
00:26:48.090 --> 00:27:05.410
Francesca Vera: or here, it says, the data should have time format, no time scale versus others. So there's data collection is not linear. That's a great one seasonality dependence on timing. So that's all actually, really, really great intuition. Because, as I believe.

228
00:27:06.280 --> 00:27:08.319
Francesca Vera: Shashi put right at the top

229
00:27:08.340 --> 00:27:15.420
Francesca Vera: time series sounds so easy as a concept, it's actually a nuanced topic. Yes, because if you think about these.

230
00:27:17.700 --> 00:27:20.519
Francesca Vera: if you think about these? These.

231
00:27:20.870 --> 00:27:21.830
Francesca Vera: you know.

232
00:27:21.940 --> 00:27:23.649
Francesca Vera: pieces of information

233
00:27:25.220 --> 00:27:34.619
Francesca Vera: there will be, or let's say you're making people fill out a form about their height, their birthday, their name. You know, there will be a timestamp.

234
00:27:34.780 --> 00:27:40.669
Francesca Vera: If anyone has used a Google forms or anything like that, there is a timestamp that is

235
00:27:41.540 --> 00:27:44.419
Francesca Vera: that that shows when the data was collected.

236
00:27:44.750 --> 00:27:55.439
Francesca Vera: So usually, if you fill out a Google form and then you import it to Google Sheets, it will show you the date and time that someone maybe put down their name, their email address, and their birthday.

237
00:27:55.950 --> 00:28:00.340
Francesca Vera: So you could actually have time in this data set.

238
00:28:00.980 --> 00:28:03.489
Francesca Vera: But, as you all pointed out.

239
00:28:03.780 --> 00:28:09.500
Francesca Vera: There's also the idea of dependence on time or the relationship with time.

240
00:28:11.470 --> 00:28:16.780
Francesca Vera: probably for this case, even if you have the timestamp that someone put in

241
00:28:17.050 --> 00:28:18.820
Francesca Vera: their information.

242
00:28:19.020 --> 00:28:33.449
Francesca Vera: You might not care right if you don't care what the time that someone put your information and all you care was the height of all the people who submitted the form. Then you're not really going to use time series analysis, right? So

243
00:28:33.850 --> 00:28:41.540
Francesca Vera: keep in mind that it's not just does the data set have time? Because if this is a Google form, I could have the timestamp of

244
00:28:41.580 --> 00:28:44.000
Francesca Vera: the people who submitted the form.

245
00:28:44.010 --> 00:28:46.860
Francesca Vera: But do I care in this case?

246
00:28:46.930 --> 00:28:49.940
Francesca Vera: Not really. So. That's why it would go here.

247
00:28:51.270 --> 00:28:53.679
Francesca Vera: And with sales

248
00:28:54.010 --> 00:28:55.930
Francesca Vera: you could have time data

249
00:28:56.000 --> 00:29:04.846
Francesca Vera: sales over time. But you could also have sales data with sales over time and not care about the time. Right? If I want to.

250
00:29:06.000 --> 00:29:09.309
Francesca Vera: if I want to predict you know

251
00:29:09.370 --> 00:29:10.850
Francesca Vera: what this

252
00:29:10.940 --> 00:29:15.929
Francesca Vera: child is going to want for Christmas, based on my toy store sales data.

253
00:29:16.400 --> 00:29:18.160
Francesca Vera: It might not matter

254
00:29:18.540 --> 00:29:20.980
Francesca Vera: the time of each sale, right?

255
00:29:21.190 --> 00:29:23.440
Francesca Vera: It might, but it also might not.

256
00:29:23.540 --> 00:29:25.680
Francesca Vera: So, thinking about what

257
00:29:25.710 --> 00:29:34.310
Francesca Vera: your problem is going back to that earlier discussion about your capstone project, you know, knowing your problem scope

258
00:29:34.470 --> 00:29:39.209
Francesca Vera: is going to help you also decide whether or not time matters.

259
00:29:39.220 --> 00:29:54.820
Francesca Vera: So something like stock prices over time might be the only thing that you care about for your capstone projects. So then it's definitely going to matter. But sales, maybe you're just trying to, you know. Figure out what you want to restock

260
00:29:55.280 --> 00:29:58.360
Francesca Vera: for Christmas, and maybe it doesn't matter what time.

261
00:29:58.450 --> 00:29:59.999
Francesca Vera: Maybe it does. Maybe it doesn't

262
00:30:01.580 --> 00:30:03.480
Francesca Vera: any any questions. So far

263
00:30:06.140 --> 00:30:11.369
Francesca Vera: it seemed like everyone had a pretty good intuition of of the types of data to work with.

264
00:30:12.870 --> 00:30:18.769
Francesca Vera: so just lifting this from the Module Information Time series data.

265
00:30:18.820 --> 00:30:21.949
Francesca Vera: the data points are ordered in time.

266
00:30:22.220 --> 00:30:24.670
Francesca Vera: So an ordered data set.

267
00:30:24.770 --> 00:30:28.809
Francesca Vera: also very important with each point corresponding to a specific time.

268
00:30:29.747 --> 00:30:39.570
Francesca Vera: regular intervals. So often the data points are collected at regular intervals, daily, monthly, yearly. Maybe. If you're

269
00:30:39.660 --> 00:30:44.947
Francesca Vera: looking at larger time jumps, you could do it, you know. Maybe you're looking at

270
00:30:46.740 --> 00:30:58.829
Francesca Vera: the sort of start to finish of kids in high school. So if you take it when they're freshmen, and then, seniors, that might be a time jump of 4 years, right or 3 years.

271
00:30:59.563 --> 00:31:05.319
Francesca Vera: So just the regular interval may may vary greatly. And then

272
00:31:06.350 --> 00:31:09.472
Francesca Vera: this is really what I was trying to say

273
00:31:10.050 --> 00:31:12.200
Francesca Vera: earlier, that

274
00:31:12.970 --> 00:31:17.840
Francesca Vera: the concept of time. It it the value of

275
00:31:18.420 --> 00:31:23.530
Francesca Vera: the outcome is influenced by previous values, and this

276
00:31:23.540 --> 00:31:37.219
Francesca Vera: then, implicitly shows that time matters because there's some concept of prior outcomes. Remember, for your data set, each data point should have a timestamp

277
00:31:37.400 --> 00:31:57.930
Francesca Vera: you can. I'm sure that you've seen in your previous. You think back to you know, the the coupon data set from practical applications. One, or maybe the many other data sets. I went over a car data set last week there will be missing values for your time series data.

278
00:31:58.100 --> 00:32:06.757
Francesca Vera: You want to make sure that any value so any output, any outcome, any prediction that you're looking at has

279
00:32:07.250 --> 00:32:09.739
Francesca Vera: has a corresponding timestamp.

280
00:32:14.500 --> 00:32:17.600
Francesca Vera: And so to break down just the title

281
00:32:17.730 --> 00:32:20.640
Francesca Vera: Time series, Analysis, and forecasting

282
00:32:21.670 --> 00:32:29.450
Francesca Vera: in the process of conducting this time series analysis. You are modeling the relationship between the outcome

283
00:32:29.650 --> 00:32:34.580
Francesca Vera: or the dependent variable, if you like to use that term and time.

284
00:32:34.940 --> 00:32:38.894
Francesca Vera: And so this is where you're looking at historical outcomes

285
00:32:39.680 --> 00:32:44.680
Francesca Vera: and actually modeling those historical outcomes over time.

286
00:32:45.240 --> 00:32:55.499
Francesca Vera: In doing so, you want to make sure that you're observing significant trends or patterns over a period of time, and this you may look at various timescales to do that.

287
00:32:56.570 --> 00:32:57.720
Francesca Vera: and

288
00:32:58.160 --> 00:33:03.650
Francesca Vera: you are also doing this step to ensure that you build an accurate model

289
00:33:03.920 --> 00:33:14.749
Francesca Vera: to enable future predictions. Remember, we're not just stopping at the analysis. We're going to carry forward this analysis by making some predictions.

290
00:33:14.880 --> 00:33:16.890
Francesca Vera: And that brings us to forecasting.

291
00:33:17.140 --> 00:33:23.650
Francesca Vera: So forecasting is then predicting future outcomes based on

292
00:33:24.030 --> 00:33:26.000
Francesca Vera: that time series analysis.

293
00:33:28.890 --> 00:33:38.529
Francesca Vera: And if you recall this fits very nicely with how we're looking at making predictions with AI

294
00:33:38.830 --> 00:33:59.659
Francesca Vera: when we make predictions with AI as a whole. So basically, for all of your capstone projects, you are going to forecast future events or make predictions based on insights from data, ie. The analysis. So this is this is exactly what we were talking about for your project, Capstone in action with Time series data

295
00:34:02.470 --> 00:34:05.259
Francesca Vera: to go over the steps of the forecasting problem.

296
00:34:05.500 --> 00:34:08.400
Francesca Vera: The 1st step collecting historical data

297
00:34:08.440 --> 00:34:10.794
Francesca Vera: ideally for your

298
00:34:11.679 --> 00:34:15.570
Francesca Vera: capstone project. You will not have to do this collection

299
00:34:16.880 --> 00:34:20.239
Francesca Vera: part ideally. You would already have

300
00:34:20.260 --> 00:34:25.169
Francesca Vera: some kind of data set if it is your you know, data set from

301
00:34:25.740 --> 00:34:34.259
Francesca Vera: maybe something a prior project that you had collected for, or it's 1 of the many, many publicly available historical data sets with

302
00:34:35.877 --> 00:34:39.499
Francesca Vera: with possible application of time series analysis.

303
00:34:40.690 --> 00:34:44.151
Francesca Vera: And then you are going to train a model. So this is

304
00:34:44.639 --> 00:34:47.360
Francesca Vera: a very high level

305
00:34:47.690 --> 00:34:53.730
Francesca Vera: heading. Can someone tell me what kinds of mini steps might go into? Number 2?

306
00:34:53.860 --> 00:34:55.849
Francesca Vera: So when we say, train a model, what?

307
00:34:57.030 --> 00:35:01.959
Francesca Vera: What? What are the actual practical steps we're taking to train a model.

308
00:35:03.090 --> 00:35:04.890
Francesca Vera: any any ideas

309
00:35:11.960 --> 00:35:13.490
Francesca Vera: I can give you one

310
00:35:14.480 --> 00:35:18.199
Francesca Vera: after we've collected the historical data.

311
00:35:18.430 --> 00:35:20.830
Francesca Vera: we might need to clean the data, right?

312
00:35:22.030 --> 00:35:27.470
Francesca Vera: So that goes under number 2, you know, maybe I, this data has

313
00:35:27.600 --> 00:35:34.339
Francesca Vera: 50 columns, and only 5 of them are relevant to my problem. So I'm gonna need to clean that up.

314
00:35:34.400 --> 00:35:35.490
Francesca Vera: Or

315
00:35:36.090 --> 00:35:42.319
Francesca Vera: maybe all the timestamps are strings, and I need to make it into a date time object.

316
00:35:42.390 --> 00:35:53.189
Francesca Vera: So I'm going to have to clean that up. And then I see here in the chat. Thank you. You're going to have to pick a model. Yes, so before you can train a model you have to know what

317
00:35:53.270 --> 00:36:07.419
Francesca Vera: kind of model you want to end up with, so that you can train it in the correct way to end up with that model. That's great. Split the data and fit the data. When you say, split the data, what are we splitting it into?

318
00:36:10.330 --> 00:36:12.859
Ravi Duvvuri: Train data and the test data.

319
00:36:12.860 --> 00:36:21.420
Francesca Vera: Yeah, perfect. So we're going to want to make sure we split into our train test sets and then fitting our training data as you put

320
00:36:21.904 --> 00:36:36.750
Francesca Vera: yeah, looking for patterns and repeatability. So maybe before you even jump into training the model, maybe you want to conduct analysis, because, say, maybe you think maybe you think weather affects your stock prices.

321
00:36:36.760 --> 00:36:48.789
Francesca Vera: and then you conduct analysis. And you notice, actually, the weather doesn't, you know, hasn't really affected stock prices in my historical data. So maybe weather is no longer going to be

322
00:36:49.446 --> 00:36:54.650
Francesca Vera: a factor in the training of your model. So yeah, looking for patterns and repeatability.

323
00:36:55.180 --> 00:37:03.799
Francesca Vera: understanding your data and cleaning it before modeling hyperparameters. Great. It sounds like everyone's got a great idea of training your model. And that's

324
00:37:03.900 --> 00:37:07.629
Francesca Vera: you know. That means everyone's been keeping up in the past few

325
00:37:08.150 --> 00:37:09.270
Francesca Vera: few weeks.

326
00:37:16.250 --> 00:37:20.899
Francesca Vera: great. And I see this question, what is the technical difference

327
00:37:21.050 --> 00:37:24.220
Francesca Vera: between the 2 between

328
00:37:25.230 --> 00:37:29.020
Francesca Vera: forecasting tomorrow's weather and

329
00:37:29.930 --> 00:37:32.729
Francesca Vera: predicting tomorrow's weather oops.

330
00:37:34.100 --> 00:37:35.350
Francesca Vera: Sorry it.

331
00:37:36.420 --> 00:37:38.620
Francesca Vera: switching between the chat and

332
00:37:38.720 --> 00:37:43.629
Francesca Vera: screen share, has paused the screen share. I think we're back now, and so

333
00:37:44.970 --> 00:37:46.629
Francesca Vera: I would say that

334
00:37:48.240 --> 00:37:51.800
Francesca Vera: in general we we like to think of.

335
00:37:53.460 --> 00:37:55.443
Francesca Vera: We like to think of

336
00:37:56.970 --> 00:38:00.793
Francesca Vera: wanting to know the future outcomes as

337
00:38:01.540 --> 00:38:02.980
Francesca Vera: predicting

338
00:38:03.210 --> 00:38:05.629
Francesca Vera: just a prediction problem. But

339
00:38:06.280 --> 00:38:11.029
Francesca Vera: usually forecasting is when there is an element of time.

340
00:38:11.410 --> 00:38:12.543
Francesca Vera: And so

341
00:38:17.540 --> 00:38:19.019
Francesca Vera: notice how

342
00:38:19.040 --> 00:38:20.670
Francesca Vera: the word predict

343
00:38:20.680 --> 00:38:36.489
Francesca Vera: in this sort of definition of forecasting exists and forecasting is really looking at, or is really the making of making predictions of future outcomes based on some time element.

344
00:38:38.250 --> 00:38:40.220
Francesca Vera: predictions may be

345
00:38:40.350 --> 00:38:42.229
Francesca Vera: more of the

346
00:38:42.240 --> 00:38:52.419
Francesca Vera: sort of discrete predictions, but I like to think of forecasting as when you are making predictions with some element of time.

347
00:38:53.270 --> 00:38:55.270
Francesca Vera: Although if you were.

348
00:38:56.430 --> 00:38:58.229
Francesca Vera: although if you were

349
00:39:03.710 --> 00:39:13.139
Francesca Vera: stating it as such, for example, if you were writing in your problem statement that I can predict tomorrow's weather, or I can forecast

350
00:39:13.230 --> 00:39:15.621
Francesca Vera: tomorrow's weather. I don't know that.

351
00:39:16.560 --> 00:39:22.100
Francesca Vera: I don't know that your learning facilitator would take issue with either one. But

352
00:39:22.260 --> 00:39:31.739
Francesca Vera: it is something that you. If you are curious, you can ask your learning facilitator as well. But I, I personally, would not take issue with either one as

353
00:39:31.820 --> 00:39:34.079
Francesca Vera: written in a problem statement.

354
00:39:35.770 --> 00:39:36.510
Francesca Vera: Great?

355
00:39:38.680 --> 00:39:42.430
Francesca Vera: okay. So then use the model to make a forecast.

356
00:39:42.500 --> 00:39:55.170
Francesca Vera: And you know you, you could easily for a different problem statement. Say, use the model to make a prediction right? Like we've we've heard that phrase used before, and then number 4 evaluate the performance of the model.

357
00:39:55.562 --> 00:39:59.789
Francesca Vera: So it seems to me like when you go 1, 2, 3

358
00:39:59.840 --> 00:40:01.020
Francesca Vera: like that's

359
00:40:01.640 --> 00:40:13.380
Francesca Vera: that achieves what the capstone says. Right like that, says the capstone wants you to make predictions with a machine learning model? Right? Why do we? Why do we use number 4?

360
00:40:13.590 --> 00:40:16.230
Francesca Vera: Why why is number 4 important to us and

361
00:40:16.330 --> 00:40:19.360
Francesca Vera: in why is it worth mentioning here?

362
00:40:21.110 --> 00:40:24.310
Carmen P.: I think it's to make sure it can

363
00:40:24.340 --> 00:40:31.480
Carmen P.: be applicable to the general population. So because it's kind of like probability just to make sure the result can be

364
00:40:32.100 --> 00:40:34.009
Carmen P.: applicable to the mass.

365
00:40:36.760 --> 00:40:38.413
Francesca Vera: Okay. So

366
00:40:39.300 --> 00:40:42.709
Francesca Vera: what? What would tell you if a model is applicable

367
00:40:43.040 --> 00:40:45.200
Francesca Vera: to the general population or not?

368
00:40:45.470 --> 00:40:46.749
Francesca Vera: How would you know that.

369
00:40:47.960 --> 00:40:54.265
Carmen P.: Based on on a percentage. Or maybe that's accuracy. Maybe I'm mixing both performance and accuracy.

370
00:40:55.177 --> 00:40:56.729
Francesca Vera: Okay? And then.

371
00:40:56.790 --> 00:40:59.050
Francesca Vera: okay? And Shashi says.

372
00:40:59.370 --> 00:41:02.079
Francesca Vera: so closer to reality.

373
00:41:02.533 --> 00:41:05.080
Francesca Vera: Yeah, i mean, you're, both pretty much

374
00:41:05.900 --> 00:41:14.859
Francesca Vera: along the same lines, I mean, what is the point of doing all of this? What is the point of doing any of this time series analysis and forecasting?

375
00:41:15.330 --> 00:41:21.110
Francesca Vera: We? We want it. If we go all the way back to here, we want to apply

376
00:41:21.160 --> 00:41:22.879
Francesca Vera: real world tools

377
00:41:23.080 --> 00:41:23.950
Francesca Vera: to

378
00:41:24.420 --> 00:41:29.449
Francesca Vera: analyze model real-world data and draw useful conclusions about real-world data.

379
00:41:29.990 --> 00:41:33.270
Francesca Vera: If we don't do this, step 4

380
00:41:33.560 --> 00:41:35.920
Francesca Vera: and see if the model

381
00:41:35.940 --> 00:41:42.440
Francesca Vera: is accurate to the real world. If it reflects the real world accurately.

382
00:41:42.730 --> 00:41:54.310
Francesca Vera: then we're then what is the use of doing this right? And so it's really really important to evaluate how well your model did, because in the grand scheme of things.

383
00:41:54.960 --> 00:41:56.360
Francesca Vera: What we want

384
00:41:56.410 --> 00:42:16.560
Francesca Vera: is to be able to use this in our jobs in our everyday life, you know. Maybe it's maybe there are some really important things on the line. If you're making forecasts of like stock market prices and so evaluating your model. That number 4 step is what takes 1, 2, 3. In this.

385
00:42:16.560 --> 00:42:27.020
Francesca Vera: you know, test environment in this experimental environment. Number 4 is what takes it to the real world, right? And we have seen in some of the lecture videos of this

386
00:42:27.070 --> 00:42:33.159
Francesca Vera: past module that one way you can even evaluate your model and evaluate how well it did

387
00:42:33.430 --> 00:42:38.890
Francesca Vera: was to compare your predictions to real life outcomes like, maybe you made predictions in

388
00:42:39.160 --> 00:42:41.069
Francesca Vera: 2017,

389
00:42:41.480 --> 00:42:55.880
Francesca Vera: and then you want to compare it to what actually happened between 2017 and 2021. Maybe your model didn't predict that Covid would happen right? And so you need to evaluate against that. You need to evaluate

390
00:42:56.080 --> 00:43:01.010
Francesca Vera: so that these models become useful to you in real life. So

391
00:43:01.413 --> 00:43:11.450
Francesca Vera: Shashi and Carmen, I think you you got it right. You got. I mean, that's that's what's that's what makes it useful to actually build these models right if you evaluate

392
00:43:11.730 --> 00:43:16.229
Francesca Vera: the performance. If you evaluate the usefulness of these models in real life.

393
00:43:19.010 --> 00:43:20.923
Francesca Vera: cool. So

394
00:43:21.910 --> 00:43:23.260
Francesca Vera: if you

395
00:43:23.810 --> 00:43:24.810
Francesca Vera: are

396
00:43:25.430 --> 00:43:32.523
Francesca Vera: looking at time series analysis. We have been introduced to this new stats model.

397
00:43:33.480 --> 00:43:37.491
Francesca Vera: statsmodels.org stats, models, package.

398
00:43:39.110 --> 00:43:47.850
Francesca Vera: I really really like that 1st of all, stats models has a bunch of available data sets.

399
00:43:48.256 --> 00:43:51.549
Francesca Vera: So the way I got to that page was

400
00:43:51.960 --> 00:43:57.720
Francesca Vera: in the colab notebook of week. 10. Video 3. There is a link

401
00:43:57.980 --> 00:44:00.770
Francesca Vera: here to stats, models, stats, models, data sets.

402
00:44:02.065 --> 00:44:08.900
Francesca Vera: So that brought me to this. And these available data sets may be

403
00:44:08.940 --> 00:44:10.650
Francesca Vera: very useful

404
00:44:10.830 --> 00:44:12.518
Francesca Vera: to you in your

405
00:44:13.140 --> 00:44:15.210
Francesca Vera: in your, in your project.

406
00:44:15.220 --> 00:44:16.410
Francesca Vera: Right? Like

407
00:44:17.020 --> 00:44:19.270
Francesca Vera: these are all real

408
00:44:19.980 --> 00:44:23.340
Francesca Vera: real world data sets that have been.

409
00:44:23.450 --> 00:44:34.910
Francesca Vera: You kind of get the helpful hint of what kinds, of what kinds of analysis and what kinds of modeling you may do on these. But I think some of these are really really interesting.

410
00:44:35.645 --> 00:44:43.840
Francesca Vera: So please take a look at these data sets. If you need some more inspiration for your project

411
00:44:49.090 --> 00:44:56.490
Francesca Vera: stats, models. Oh, actually, as you can see here, stats, models also has a bunch of other

412
00:44:57.430 --> 00:45:08.129
Francesca Vera: statistical tools. You can see they, it also provides some regression and linear models. But for the purposes of

413
00:45:08.480 --> 00:45:14.530
Francesca Vera: these, of this, of this module we've been looking at Time series analysis, but

414
00:45:14.610 --> 00:45:21.309
Francesca Vera: just wanted to give you the full picture. I don't think Github was working earlier.

415
00:45:21.680 --> 00:45:24.479
Francesca Vera: but not to worry

416
00:45:32.030 --> 00:45:32.810
Francesca Vera: great.

417
00:45:33.510 --> 00:45:52.219
Francesca Vera: And so in this stats, modules, package. I loaded one of the data sets from the lectures, because it really inspired me to cover a few things. One was to look at documentation for new methods or new functions that were introduced to. So I'll get to that.

418
00:45:52.950 --> 00:45:55.330
Francesca Vera: But I also thought it was really

419
00:45:55.350 --> 00:46:00.269
Francesca Vera: interesting, because it it made me reflect on how

420
00:46:01.020 --> 00:46:10.030
Francesca Vera: different people might decompose the same problem in the very same colab notebook in very different ways.

421
00:46:10.750 --> 00:46:15.649
Francesca Vera: So let me actually just jump into the notebook right here. So

422
00:46:16.530 --> 00:46:21.080
Francesca Vera: I will just run everything from the start, just to make sure.

423
00:46:21.620 --> 00:46:24.719
Francesca Vera: You'll if you don't remember. In the

424
00:46:24.840 --> 00:46:30.410
Francesca Vera: in the lecture, video, where this notebook occurs. It was

425
00:46:30.630 --> 00:46:32.040
Francesca Vera: very much

426
00:46:32.510 --> 00:46:35.029
Francesca Vera: showing that you can generate

427
00:46:35.140 --> 00:46:50.699
Francesca Vera: your own time series. If you want to just practice using various methods. If you want to practice actually conducting the analysis on toy data. You can generate various random time series, as you can see. When I regenerated a new random

428
00:46:51.370 --> 00:47:02.469
Francesca Vera: data set it generated, you know, a plot to reflect that. I can also increase this number. So this is very much like your experimental playground

429
00:47:02.490 --> 00:47:03.135
Francesca Vera: for

430
00:47:04.110 --> 00:47:05.000
Francesca Vera: just

431
00:47:05.360 --> 00:47:12.229
Francesca Vera: trying out various time series data. So just wanted to make sure we were all aware of that. And then

432
00:47:12.667 --> 00:47:23.140
Francesca Vera: here plotting the auto correlations, and we can see. Yes, you know, the exponential trend and and hinting at sort of the the Stationary time series.

433
00:47:24.910 --> 00:47:30.469
Francesca Vera: So I actually want to go into, and I'll just import these for the sake of

434
00:47:30.570 --> 00:47:36.219
Francesca Vera: making sure we don't get any errors. I actually really want to focus on

435
00:47:36.470 --> 00:47:48.279
Francesca Vera: the thought process that was shown to us in the lecture with regards to the sunspots data. So we are all we should all be very familiar with how to load

436
00:47:48.910 --> 00:47:50.720
Francesca Vera: into our Pandas

437
00:47:51.070 --> 00:47:59.390
Francesca Vera: data frame. Here we have perfectly this, you know. Csv sunspot. Csv, we can see that each value.

438
00:47:59.530 --> 00:48:01.000
Francesca Vera: each value

439
00:48:01.590 --> 00:48:03.360
Francesca Vera: has a corresponding

440
00:48:03.781 --> 00:48:14.348
Francesca Vera: date. And so we're thinking, okay, perfect for some kind of time series analysis, right? And we can even see, okay, this is this is the

441
00:48:15.030 --> 00:48:18.680
Francesca Vera: the value stored in the 1st

442
00:48:19.070 --> 00:48:21.609
Francesca Vera: 1st item under the date column.

443
00:48:22.160 --> 00:48:26.969
Francesca Vera: And so the next thing that we got introduced to was, Okay.

444
00:48:27.770 --> 00:48:29.970
Francesca Vera: this looks like a string

445
00:48:30.050 --> 00:48:37.499
Francesca Vera: oops. This looks like a string, we can tell, because it has those sort of quotation marks that denote a string.

446
00:48:38.860 --> 00:48:45.690
Francesca Vera: But we know we want it to be in a date time format, not a string.

447
00:48:46.600 --> 00:48:48.820
Francesca Vera: So how are we going to do that?

448
00:48:49.410 --> 00:48:54.009
Francesca Vera: And this is why I was inspired by this decomposing a problem

449
00:48:54.570 --> 00:48:55.810
Francesca Vera: because

450
00:48:56.360 --> 00:49:01.049
Francesca Vera: we could do we could tackle this problem of, you know.

451
00:49:01.140 --> 00:49:09.010
Francesca Vera: cleaning our data so that we can get it into a nice format so that we can perform some time series analysis. One way we could do it

452
00:49:09.180 --> 00:49:16.799
Francesca Vera: is by working front to back. So front to back means like at the start. So assuming the

453
00:49:16.960 --> 00:49:18.220
Francesca Vera: data set

454
00:49:18.660 --> 00:49:22.020
Francesca Vera: loaded into your pandas data frame. That's the start.

455
00:49:22.190 --> 00:49:25.700
Francesca Vera: And then the back or the finish. The finished product

456
00:49:25.830 --> 00:49:31.930
Francesca Vera: might be okay, creating a usable time series based on that data. Right?

457
00:49:32.100 --> 00:49:34.820
Francesca Vera: So we have our data set. We loaded it into a.

458
00:49:34.940 --> 00:49:39.629
Francesca Vera: our patents data frame, and we want to eventually be able to conduct

459
00:49:39.640 --> 00:49:42.079
Francesca Vera: time series analysis on it.

460
00:49:42.940 --> 00:49:47.040
Francesca Vera: So that's front to back. How do we get from the

461
00:49:47.420 --> 00:49:51.040
Francesca Vera: data set loading to time series analysis.

462
00:49:51.400 --> 00:49:54.400
Francesca Vera: And then there's also back to front, which is

463
00:49:54.490 --> 00:49:57.389
Francesca Vera: okay. I know I want to have

464
00:49:57.430 --> 00:50:00.279
Francesca Vera: some time series analysis at the end of it.

465
00:50:00.660 --> 00:50:03.899
Francesca Vera: What steps if I'm moving backwards?

466
00:50:04.050 --> 00:50:05.639
Francesca Vera: Do I need to do

467
00:50:06.240 --> 00:50:08.900
Francesca Vera: to get back to the original

468
00:50:09.870 --> 00:50:12.910
Francesca Vera: thing that I have, which is just this. Csv.

469
00:50:13.950 --> 00:50:23.760
Francesca Vera: so I would say that many of the problems that we've been doing. You know, many of the practices we've been doing have very much been you know.

470
00:50:24.180 --> 00:50:27.249
Francesca Vera: you are given a data. You were given a data set.

471
00:50:27.280 --> 00:50:34.900
Francesca Vera: and then you're given instructions how to move from start to finish. Right from that data set. Maybe you're given the sunspot data set and then

472
00:50:34.950 --> 00:50:38.199
Francesca Vera: you move, start to finish until you get to the

473
00:50:38.300 --> 00:50:41.019
Francesca Vera: Time Series analysis. But

474
00:50:41.310 --> 00:50:43.250
Francesca Vera: maybe you

475
00:50:43.280 --> 00:50:46.939
Francesca Vera: want to. You, you know, you want to do time series analysis.

476
00:50:46.980 --> 00:50:50.640
Francesca Vera: and you have to figure out how to get

477
00:50:50.810 --> 00:50:54.379
Francesca Vera: back to your data set. And by that I mean.

478
00:50:56.350 --> 00:50:58.360
Francesca Vera: I have my data set loaded.

479
00:51:00.590 --> 00:51:06.020
Francesca Vera: and I know this cannot be the format that time. You know, my time series exists.

480
00:51:06.150 --> 00:51:10.210
Francesca Vera: So I'm thinking, okay, let's say, I have this time series.

481
00:51:10.280 --> 00:51:14.260
Francesca Vera: What do I need for it? Okay. Moving back one step.

482
00:51:14.400 --> 00:51:20.809
Francesca Vera: I know I need to have all the values, the dependent variables, the outputs.

483
00:51:21.040 --> 00:51:25.399
Francesca Vera: Okay? And then moving back, I know I need to have all

484
00:51:25.490 --> 00:51:30.860
Francesca Vera: the Timestamps or the date time objects associated with those

485
00:51:31.410 --> 00:51:32.490
Francesca Vera: variables.

486
00:51:33.330 --> 00:51:35.030
Francesca Vera: Okay? Then, I'm moving back.

487
00:51:38.200 --> 00:51:41.789
Francesca Vera: I know I need to have a data set that has

488
00:51:41.820 --> 00:51:44.710
Francesca Vera: the variables and the Associated

489
00:51:45.460 --> 00:51:51.750
Francesca Vera: Timestamps. And then I'm moving back. I need to make sure that my data set

490
00:51:53.440 --> 00:51:55.690
Francesca Vera: time or date.

491
00:51:55.820 --> 00:51:58.169
Francesca Vera: Information is in a date time

492
00:51:58.570 --> 00:52:02.920
Francesca Vera: format. And then I'm moving back. And then I end up in my Csv.

493
00:52:03.100 --> 00:52:08.039
Francesca Vera: and so what I'm trying to say is that when you decompose a problem.

494
00:52:09.650 --> 00:52:14.150
Francesca Vera: It's important to know what your starting point is, which is usually your data set.

495
00:52:14.390 --> 00:52:22.259
Francesca Vera: But it's equally important to know before you jump in for this this case. What you want your finished outcome to be.

496
00:52:24.390 --> 00:52:29.150
Francesca Vera: I'm sorry if that confused you. Are there any questions?

497
00:52:31.040 --> 00:52:34.447
Francesca Vera: with with that? Because that was, I know that was a lot of

498
00:52:34.740 --> 00:52:36.140
Francesca Vera: talking at once.

499
00:52:40.040 --> 00:52:43.500
Francesca Vera: Okay, so I'll just jump in then, in this case so

500
00:52:43.870 --> 00:52:48.459
Francesca Vera: great. So here, I know I have my data set.

501
00:52:48.770 --> 00:53:01.889
Francesca Vera: and I have my date as a string, and when I was going backwards and backwards I remember that I said, oh, I need to have things in a date time format so that I can make my time series.

502
00:53:02.530 --> 00:53:06.169
Francesca Vera: So the next thing I'll do right is make

503
00:53:06.770 --> 00:53:07.790
Francesca Vera: my

504
00:53:11.980 --> 00:53:23.019
Francesca Vera: my item in this date time format no longer the string, but, as you can see, it has also this time 0 0, just because there was no time value in it.

505
00:53:24.880 --> 00:53:27.889
Francesca Vera: And then let's say that

506
00:53:27.900 --> 00:53:29.810
Francesca Vera: I want to

507
00:53:31.570 --> 00:53:32.670
Francesca Vera: then

508
00:53:33.110 --> 00:53:35.200
Francesca Vera: do this for the entire column.

509
00:53:35.900 --> 00:53:37.180
Francesca Vera: I'm going to

510
00:53:37.380 --> 00:53:40.620
Francesca Vera: do this for the entire column. And so now I'm here.

511
00:53:41.430 --> 00:53:45.059
Francesca Vera: And then I'm looking at this and thinking to myself, Okay.

512
00:53:45.740 --> 00:53:56.339
Francesca Vera: I know I needed the value. And I needed the date time format right? I told myself that earlier, when I was stepping backwards and backwards and backwards.

513
00:53:57.020 --> 00:53:59.509
Francesca Vera: So what I don't need is

514
00:54:00.480 --> 00:54:08.130
Francesca Vera: everything else right? So that's why, I know that I can then drop these columns because I don't need

515
00:54:09.000 --> 00:54:14.169
Francesca Vera: any of these things, and I told myself, such when I was moving back.

516
00:54:15.970 --> 00:54:17.709
Francesca Vera: is everyone with me so far.

517
00:54:20.650 --> 00:54:25.310
Francesca Vera: In the in the example there was a renaming of the column. I will, just

518
00:54:25.370 --> 00:54:27.279
Francesca Vera: for the purposes of

519
00:54:27.490 --> 00:54:33.510
Francesca Vera: completing, you know. Maybe I saw this, and I didn't like my various columns, so I'll rename my column

520
00:54:33.880 --> 00:54:38.040
Francesca Vera: and then, now I'm now, I'm thinking to myself, okay.

521
00:54:39.300 --> 00:54:45.920
Francesca Vera: did I do all the steps when I was working backwards and backwards to get to my final

522
00:54:48.016 --> 00:54:50.760
Francesca Vera: to my final destination.

523
00:54:52.660 --> 00:54:55.900
Francesca Vera: And so I'm just going to plot everything.

524
00:54:56.370 --> 00:54:57.820
Francesca Vera: Okay. It

525
00:54:58.110 --> 00:55:00.450
Francesca Vera: looks like I have some kind of

526
00:55:02.320 --> 00:55:05.290
Francesca Vera: some kind of time series. And then I'm able to just

527
00:55:05.460 --> 00:55:07.630
Francesca Vera: actually conduct my analysis.

528
00:55:08.140 --> 00:55:09.250
Francesca Vera: So

529
00:55:09.740 --> 00:55:14.740
Francesca Vera: this was just to illustrate that, to get through your

530
00:55:14.750 --> 00:55:18.020
Francesca Vera: you know your thinking process. You're decomposing of the problem.

531
00:55:18.400 --> 00:55:30.840
Francesca Vera: I would I could do it from start to finish where I could just do low. You know, I could memorize. Okay, I load my data set. And then I, you know, check for duplicates. And then I check for missing values.

532
00:55:30.930 --> 00:55:33.121
Francesca Vera: And then I check for

533
00:55:33.690 --> 00:55:57.070
Francesca Vera: you know, value types, you know. That's very much what the what the process we've been really practicing has been right, like we've been doing things step by step. It's almost mechanical. It's we're we're building a muscle memory to know. Okay, every time I want to clean. I'm looking for duplicates. I'm looking for missing values. Do I want to drop a column? That's very start to finish right front front to back.

534
00:55:57.660 --> 00:56:09.089
Francesca Vera: But there is also another way to do it, which is sort of how I was approaching this, which is back to front. Maybe I'm starting with. I know that I want my finished outcome

535
00:56:09.480 --> 00:56:13.989
Francesca Vera: to be the prediction of patients who are at risk for a heart attack.

536
00:56:14.300 --> 00:56:21.979
Francesca Vera: So now I'm going to go back. Okay, patients at risk for a heart attack. What kind of problem is that? Okay, it's a classification problem.

537
00:56:22.080 --> 00:56:27.539
Francesca Vera: Then I'll go one step back. Do I know any classification algorithms for it.

538
00:56:27.730 --> 00:56:32.700
Francesca Vera: Yes, I do. I know logistic regression. Then I'll go one step back

539
00:56:32.760 --> 00:56:34.469
Francesca Vera: and I'll go. Okay.

540
00:56:34.480 --> 00:56:44.710
Francesca Vera: If I know that I want to do classification with logistic regression. What kind of data input can I put into my logistic regression model?

541
00:56:45.520 --> 00:56:50.409
Francesca Vera: Then I'll go back and I'm gonna put. Oh, I can put this type of data

542
00:56:50.850 --> 00:57:01.059
Francesca Vera: with, you know, looking at maybe patient age. If they were a smoker, if they have a history of previous heart attacks. Okay, then I'll go one step back and go.

543
00:57:01.470 --> 00:57:05.030
Francesca Vera: Do I need to know? In my data set.

544
00:57:05.340 --> 00:57:18.319
Francesca Vera: you know. Is it labeled or unlabeled? Do I need to know if people were at risk before I'm going to say yes, I do for logistic regression. So then I'm going to go back and back and back and back. And eventually I'm going to end up at my

545
00:57:18.400 --> 00:57:27.690
Francesca Vera: Csv of patient data that has been labeled. Whether or not they were at risk for a heart attack. Do you get what I'm saying? It's sort of like

546
00:57:28.000 --> 00:57:40.789
Francesca Vera: I could have started with that data set and weaved my way all down to my final logistic regression model that predicts if a patient has a risk for heart attack. But I can also start from the

547
00:57:40.910 --> 00:57:43.230
Francesca Vera: and which was, I want to predict.

548
00:57:43.710 --> 00:57:55.030
Francesca Vera: a patient is at risk. And I'm moving back. Okay, so do I need to have labeled data, what does that label data need to look like, what kind of model could I use like moving back and back?

549
00:57:55.140 --> 00:57:57.809
Francesca Vera: So I wanted to just express that

550
00:57:57.890 --> 00:58:00.770
Francesca Vera: even for something as simple as

551
00:58:01.000 --> 00:58:17.099
Francesca Vera: what we just did, which was getting our sunspots. Csv. Ready for some time. Series analysis, even something simple like that you can apply moving back and back and back, as well as starting up here and moving forward.

552
00:58:19.540 --> 00:58:26.934
Francesca Vera: And that is actually the end of the time. I do want to just express that

553
00:58:27.620 --> 00:58:29.169
Francesca Vera: module 10 is due

554
00:58:30.420 --> 00:58:31.410
Francesca Vera: November.

555
00:58:31.780 --> 00:58:37.110
Francesca Vera: I think that is wrong. Sorry. 14.th

556
00:58:37.940 --> 00:58:45.809
Francesca Vera: practical applications. 2 is coming up. If you remember practical applications. One. Think back to your feedback.

557
00:58:46.310 --> 00:58:50.379
Francesca Vera: look over it, if necessary, because practical applications 2 is coming up

558
00:58:50.750 --> 00:58:51.970
Francesca Vera: and

559
00:58:52.050 --> 00:58:53.080
Francesca Vera: always

560
00:58:53.230 --> 00:59:02.449
Francesca Vera: be thinking about your capstone projects and sort of opportunities, and you will have those one-on-one consultations in the near future.

561
00:59:05.660 --> 00:59:06.420
Francesca Vera: Great!

562
00:59:06.790 --> 00:59:07.460
Francesca Vera: It's

563
00:59:11.738 --> 00:59:23.680
Francesca Vera: and Matt. I see you have a question. Would you be willing to submit a ticket on this question, and we can converse there. Does that work for you?

564
00:59:26.520 --> 00:59:28.730
Francesca Vera: Great, all right, and thank you all.

565
00:59:28.890 --> 00:59:29.740
Francesca Vera: Thanks.

566
00:59:33.650 --> 00:59:36.590
Francesca Vera: Oh, 13, th thank you. There you go

567
00:59:37.380 --> 00:59:41.140
Francesca Vera: Every date that I had written was was the wrong date. Thanks, Shashi.
