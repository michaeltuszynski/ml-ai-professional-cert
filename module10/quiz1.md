# Time Series Analysis Quiz

## Question 1 (1 point)
Which of the following models does not represent time series data?

**Options:**
1. Autoregressive
2. Moving average
3. Autocorrelation
4. ARMA

**Answer:** Option 3: Autocorrelation
> Autocorrelation is a statistical measure that shows the relationship between observations at different time points, not a model. The other options (Autoregressive, Moving average, and ARMA) are actual time series modeling techniques used to represent and analyze time series data.

## Question 2 (1 point)
Given some historical data along a time series, what is predicting the future over some time period referred to as?

**Options:**
1. Clustering problem
2. Regression problem
3. Forecasting problem
4. Classification problem

**Answer:** Option 3: Forecasting problem
> In time series analysis, predicting future values based on historical data is explicitly called forecasting. As stated in the lectures, this is the standard terminology in time series analysis.

## Question 3 (1 point)
Which of the following techniques is not commonly used to calculate the error of a model for time series data?

**Options:**
1. Mean absolute percentage error (MAPE)
2. Mean absolute error (MAE)
3. Mean squared error (MSE)
4. Root mean squared error (RMSE)

**Answer:** Option 3: Mean squared error (MSE)
> While MSE is used as an intermediate step in calculating RMSE, it is less commonly used directly as an error metric compared to MAE, MAPE, and RMSE. The lectures specifically highlight MAE and RMSE as the primary error metrics for time series evaluation, with MAPE being useful for percentage-based interpretations.

## Answer Key
1. Option 3 - Autocorrelation (Statistical measure for analyzing relationships between observations, not a model)
2. Option 3 - Forecasting problem (Standard terminology for predicting future values in time series)
3. Option 3 - MSE (Less commonly used directly as an error metric, though used in calculating RMSE)
