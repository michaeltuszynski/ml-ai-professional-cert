# Mini-Lesson 8.1: Prediction vs. Inference

In Video 8.3, Professor Hug discussed prediction and inference models. This program consists mainly of prediction models; however, it is essential to understand inference. Each term is defined below.

## Prediction

Prediction is a word that is often used to describe a conclusive statement that pertains to a future event or occurrence. This program has already enlightened you about many predictive models, such as linear regression. As you may know, prediction is about estimating the value of the response variable based on predictor or input variables.

## Inference

Conversely, inference is about understanding the relationship between the response and the predictor variables. Inference models also place a high priority on interpretability and understanding of the results.

## Key Distinction

Overall, inference and prediction are two words with similar meanings. Therefore, it may be challenging to understand their differences. Try to remember this key distinction: inference is generally used to conclude something about the present, while prediction always pertains to a future event or occurrence. The table below is a quick reference to help you understand the differences.

### Inference vs. Prediction

| Parameter for Comparison | Inference | Prediction |
|-------------------------|-----------|------------|
| Definition | Inference describes a conclusion that is based on empirical evidence regarding data, facts, and evidence. | Prediction describes a conclusive statement that pertains to a future event or occurrence. |
| Answers the question | What do the relationships between the variables mean? | How can I accurately predict new data points? |
| Goal | Estimate an association between an outcome, a variable, and a predictor variable. | Develop a "best" model (where all predictors predict Y with high accuracy and low error). |
| Example | What has the biggest impact on fuel efficiency: horsepower or weight? | Given horsepower, what is a vehicle's fuel efficiency? |
| Confidence of conclusion | Since inference is based on facts and evidence, you can have more confidence that the conclusion is correct. | Compared to inference, there is less certainty that a prediction will be correct because the future is unknown. |
