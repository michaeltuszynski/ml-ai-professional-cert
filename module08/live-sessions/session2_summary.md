- Multiple Regression
- Collinearity and VIF (Variance Inflation Factor)

## Simple Linear Regression Analysis
- Fundamental concept: Finding correlation between independent and dependent variables
- Key components:
  - Scatter plot visualization
  - Fitting a straight line through data points
  - Minimizing squared residuals (Ordinary Least Squares)
  - Testing significance of the slope

## Residual Analysis
### Key Properties to Check
- Scatter plot of residuals
  - Should look like a "flat pipe" around zero
  - Avoid fan shapes or patterns
  - Test for homoscedasticity

### Histogram of Residuals
- Should approximate normal distribution
- Used to verify assumptions of linear regression

### Q-Q Plot (Quantile-Quantile Plot)
- Compares residual distribution to normal distribution
- Points should follow the diagonal line
- Helps identify deviations from normality

## Transformations in Regression
### Tukey Plot Approach
- Used to determine appropriate transformations
- Based on scatter plot patterns
- Common transformations:
  - Log transformation (log(x), log(y), or both)
  - Inverse transformation (1/x, 1/y)
  - Square transformations

### Benefits of Transformations
- Can improve model fit
- Makes non-linear relationships linear
- Example shown: GDP vs CO2 emissions
  - Log-log transformation significantly improved fit
  - Demonstrated power of simple transformations

## Multiple Regression
### Key Considerations
- Using multiple independent variables
- Adjusted R-squared preferred over R-squared
- Need to watch for collinearity between variables

### Variance Inflation Factor (VIF)
- Measures collinearity between independent variables
- VIF > 5 indicates potential collinearity issues
- Example shown with stock market indices:
  - Market and Dow Jones showed high VIF
  - Solution: Average the correlated variables or choose one based on domain knowledge

## Best Practices
- Start with simple regression before adding complexity
- Check residual properties thoroughly
- Consider transformations before adding variables
- Use domain knowledge when dealing with collinearity
- Take an iterative approach to model improvement

## Real-World Applications
- Capital Asset Pricing Model (CAPM)
  - Beta coefficient is slope from simple regression
  - Used in financial markets
- Pricing Strategies
  - Revenue optimization
  - Profit maximization
- Economic Analysis
  - GDP vs emissions relationships
  - Market index correlations

## Implementation Tips
- Use appropriate libraries (statsmodels, scikit-learn)
- Consider computational efficiency
- Document transformation decisions
- Validate assumptions at each step
- Remember to reverse transformations for interpretation when needed
