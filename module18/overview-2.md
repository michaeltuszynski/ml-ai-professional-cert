# Overview: Normalization

Text normalization reduces variations in text forms, bringing it closer to a predefined "standard." In this way, you can reduce the amount of different information the computer must process and improve its efficiency. Normalization techniques, such as stemming and lemmatization, also reduce inflectional and sometimes derived word forms to a single base form.

## Text normalization includes:

* Converting all letters to lowercase or uppercase
* Converting numbers into words or removing numbers
* Removing punctuation, accent marks, and other special characters
* Removing white space
* Expanding abbreviations
* Removing stop words, sparse terms, and particular words
* Canonicalizing text
