# Live Session 3 Summary

## Session Overview
This session covered two main topics:
1. Updates on the capstone project deliverables and scheduling
2. A detailed walkthrough of image classification approaches using a fashion dataset

## Capstone Project Updates
- Next deliverable: First version of Jupyter notebook due February 3rd/4th
  - Should include EDA components
  - Not the final version
- Students can schedule follow-up meetings using the same calendar link
  - Recommended timing: early/mid-February
  - Purpose: Check progress and adjust scope if needed

## Image Classification Demo
The main portion of the session demonstrated three different approaches to image classification using the Fashion MNIST dataset.

### Dataset Overview
- Fashion MNIST dataset from Keras
- Contains 60,000 training images and 10,000 test images
- 10 different clothing categories (t-shirts, trousers, etc.)
- Images are grayscale
- For demo purposes, used 10,000 randomly sampled images for training

### Libraries Used
- OpenCV (cv2) - Computer vision library
- PIL (Python Imaging Library) - Image processing
- TensorFlow/Keras - For dataset
- scikit-image - Feature extraction
- Standard ML libraries (numpy, pandas, etc.)

### Approach 1: Feature Extraction Only
- Extracted features from images:
  - Color histograms
  - Texture features (HOG - Histogram of Oriented Gradients)
  - Local Binary Patterns
- Results:
  - Lower performance (F1 score ~0.34)
  - Demonstrated baseline using only extracted features

### Approach 2: Raw Pixels Only
- Used raw pixel values directly
- Reshaped pixel data for SVM input
- Results:
  - Much better performance (F1 score ~0.85)
  - Significant improvement over feature extraction only

### Approach 3: Combined Features
- Combined extracted features with raw pixels
- Results:
  - Performance decreased (F1 score ~0.76)
  - Possibly due to feature redundancy or interactions

### Analysis & Insights
1. Confusion Matrix Analysis
   - Revealed patterns in misclassifications
   - Example: T-shirts often confused with shirts/dresses
   - Can guide feature engineering decisions

2. Potential Improvements
   - Add more training data
   - Include additional relevant features (e.g., collar type for shirts)
   - Parameter tuning for SVM
   - Consider color information
   - Explore boundary detection
   - Try neural network approaches (CNN)

## Key Learnings & Best Practices
1. Model Development Process
   - Start simple and incrementally add complexity
   - Analyze confusion matrices for insights
   - Document assumptions and decisions
   - Consider both data quantity and quality

2. Feature Engineering
   - Balance between raw data and engineered features
   - Consider domain knowledge when adding features
   - Evaluate feature interactions and redundancy

3. Model Deployment Considerations
   - Need for ML infrastructure (MLflow, Kubeflow, Metaflow)
   - Importance of model lifecycle management
   - Containerization and API endpoints
   - Continuous training with new data

## Q&A Highlights
1. Image Features
   - Discussion of pixel representation
   - Feature extraction techniques
   - Color and texture analysis

2. Model Improvement
   - Handling new data variations
   - Synthetic data generation
   - Balancing data distributions

3. Production Deployment
