# Overview: Preprocessing Text

In NLP, text preprocessing is the first step in cleansing text data and preparing it for the model. Text data can contain noise in various forms, such as emotion, punctuation, or case-sensitive text. Additionally, as any user of human language knows, a person can express the same idea in many ways, which can cause difficulty for ML models. For these reasons, and because computers generally cannot understand words, an efficient method of converting text into numbers is necessary.

## Text Preprocessing Steps

1. Tokenization
2. Lower casing
3. Stop words removal
4. Stemming
5. Lemmatization

Text preprocessing steps such as these are efficient in reducing data dimensionality. By reducing dimensions, text mining procedures can process data with fewer terms and improve the performance of clustering techniques.
