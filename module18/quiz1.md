# Natural Language Processing (NLP) Quiz

## Question 1 (1 point)
What is the primary goal of NLP?

**Options:**
1. To enable computers to understand, interpret, and generate human language.
2. To design virtual reality environments for immersive experiences.
3. To develop algorithms for playing chess and other board games.
4. To create realistic human-like robots.

**Answer:** Option 1: To enable computers to understand, interpret, and generate human language.

*Explanation:* NLP's core purpose is to bridge the gap between human communication and computer understanding. It focuses on developing systems that can process, analyze, and generate natural language, making human-computer interaction more natural and effective.

## Question 2 (1 point)
What activities typically occur in the preprocessing step of NLP?

**Options:**
1. Data is stored in a database for quick access.
2. Algorithms are trained to understand grammar rules.
3. Raw text data undergoes tokenization and normalization.
4. Sentences are translated into multiple languages.

**Answer:** Option 3: Raw text data undergoes tokenization and normalization.

*Explanation:* Preprocessing in NLP involves fundamental text cleaning and preparation steps. Tokenization breaks text into smaller units (words/subwords), while normalization standardizes the text format - these are essential first steps before any advanced NLP processing.

## Question 3 (1 point)
What is the name of a raw dataset in NLP?

**Options:**
1. Algorithm
2. Template
3. Corpus
4. Index

**Answer:** Option 3: Corpus

*Explanation:* A corpus is the technical term for a collection of text documents used in NLP. It serves as the raw dataset for training and testing NLP models.

## Question 4 (1 point)
What is the purpose of text tokenization in NLP?

**Options:**
1. To convert text into a numeric representation.
2. To generate grammatically correct sentences.
3. To split text into smaller units, such as words or subwords.
4. To summarize long documents into key points.

**Answer:** Option 3: To split text into smaller units, such as words or subwords.

*Explanation:* Tokenization is the fundamental process of breaking down text into smaller units (tokens) such as words, subwords, or characters. This is a crucial preprocessing step that enables further NLP analysis and processing.
