# Financial Document Classification Capstone Project

## Project Overview
My capstone project aims to develop a machine learning model that can automatically classify various types of financial fund administration documents based on their content, regardless of their format or structure. The goal is to create a robust system that can accurately categorize these specialized financial documents without relying on standardized templates or layouts, thereby streamlining fund administration processes.

## Data Requirements

### Document Types
The dataset will include diverse fund administration documents such as:
- Net Asset Value (NAV) statements
- Investor subscription and redemption forms
- Fund performance reports
- Regulatory filings (e.g., Form PF, AIFMD reports)
- Partnership agreements and offering memoranda
- Audit reports and financial statements
- Investor correspondence
- Trade confirmations and custodian reports

### Required Data Elements
- Labels or categories for each document in the dataset
- Text content extracted from the documents (OCR may be required for scanned documents)
- Metadata such as:
  - Document layout
  - Presence of specific fields
  - Key-value pairs

## Technical Approach

The following techniques will be employed:

1. **Natural Language Processing (NLP)**
   - Text analysis and feature extraction from document content
   - Processing of specialized financial terminology

2. **Computer Vision**
   - Analysis of document structure and layout
   - Handling various formats of fund administration documents

3. **Machine Learning Classification**
   - Implementation of algorithms such as:
     - Random Forests
     - Support Vector Machines
     - Neural Networks
   - Incorporation of domain-specific features
