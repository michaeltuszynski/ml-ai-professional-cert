# Module 9 Live Session Summary

## Overview
This live session covered key concepts in machine learning, focusing on:
- Overfitting and its prevention
- Sequential Feature Selection
- Ridge and Lasso Regression
- Practical demonstration using a car price prediction dataset

## Key Topics

### 1. Overfitting
- Definition: When a model learns too well from training data but performs poorly on new data
- Signs of overfitting:
  - Large gap between training and testing accuracy (>10-15% difference is concerning)
  - Training accuracy much higher than testing accuracy
- Prevention methods:
  - Getting more data when possible
  - Cross-validation
  - Data augmentation
  - Feature selection
  - Hyperparameter tuning

### 2. Feature Selection
- Purpose:
  - Improve computational efficiency
  - Remove irrelevant features and noise
  - Prevent overfitting
- Types covered:
  - Sequential Forward Selection (SFS)
  - Sequential Backward Selection (SBS)
  - Recursive Feature Elimination (RFE)

### 3. Regularization Methods
- Ridge Regression
  - Adds penalty term to loss function
  - Uses alpha parameter for shrinkage
- Lasso Regression
  - Similar to Ridge but can reduce coefficients to zero
  - Useful for feature selection
  - Uses absolute value in penalty term

## Practical Demonstration

### Dataset Overview
- Car price prediction dataset
- Features included:
  - Numerical: horsepower, engine size, dimensions, etc.
  - Categorical: fuel type, body type, etc.
  - Target variable: car price

### Data Preprocessing Steps
1. Initial data cleaning
   - Removed irrelevant columns (car_id, symboling, car_name)
   - Handled categorical variables using get_dummies
   - Applied StandardScaler for feature scaling

### Model Comparison
Three regression models were compared:
1. Linear Regression
   - Showed signs of overfitting (91% train vs 77% test accuracy)
2. Lasso Regression
   - Used grid search for hyperparameter tuning
   - Alpha = 100 performed best
3. Ridge Regression
   - Best performing model
   - Alpha = 10
   - Still showed some overfitting (11% difference between train/test)

## Best Practices & Tips
1. Never expect 100% accuracy - it indicates an error in the implementation
2. Use StandardScaler when features are measured in different units
3. For small datasets:
   - Use a smaller test set (20% vs 30%)
   - Consider getting more data if possible
4. Always visualize data:
   - Box plots for categorical variables
   - Scatter plots for numerical variables
   - Correlation heatmaps

## Upcoming Course Information
- Module 10 next week
- Module 11 will have a practical application assignment
  - Similar car price prediction task
  - Larger dataset with missing values
  - Will require applying similar techniques demonstrated in this session
- One-on-one consultations available for capstone project planning
